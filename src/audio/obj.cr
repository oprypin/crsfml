  # The audio listener is the point in the scene
  # from where all the sounds are heard
  #
  # The audio listener defines the global properties of the
  # audio environment, it defines where and how sounds and musics
  # are heard. If `SF::View` is the eyes of the user, then `SF::Listener`
  # is his ears (by the way, they are often linked together --
  # same position, orientation, etc.).
  #
  # `SF::Listener` is a simple interface, which allows to setup the
  # listener in the 3D audio environment (position, direction and
  # up vector), and to adjust the global volume.
  #
  # Because the listener is unique in the scene, `SF::Listener` only
  # contains static functions and doesn't have to be instantiated.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # # Move the listener to the position (1, 0, -5)
  # SF::Listener.set_position(1, 0, -5)
  #
  # # Make it face the right axis (1, 0, 0)
  # SF::Listener.direction = SF.vector3f(1, 0, 0)
  #
  # # Reduce the global volume
  # SF::Listener.global_volume = 50
  # ```

  # Abstract base class for streamed audio sources
  #
  # Unlike audio buffers (see `SF::SoundBuffer`), audio streams
  # are never completely loaded in memory. Instead, the audio
  # data is acquired continuously while the stream is playing.
  # This behavior allows to play a sound with no loading delay,
  # and keeps the memory consumption very low.
  #
  # Sound sources that need to be streamed are usually big files
  # (compressed audio musics that would eat hundreds of MB in memory)
  # or files that would take a lot of time to be received
  # (sounds played over the network).
  #
  # `SF::SoundStream` is a base class that doesn't care about the
  # stream source, which is left to the derived class. SFML provides
  # a built-in specialization for big files (see `SF::Music`).
  # No network stream source is provided, but you can write your own
  # by combining this class with the network module.
  #
  # A derived class has to override two virtual functions:
  #
  # * on_get_data fills a new chunk of audio data to be played
  # * on_seek changes the current playing position in the source
  #
  # It is important to note that each SoundStream is played in its
  # own separate thread, so that the streaming loop doesn't block the
  # rest of the program. In particular, the OnGetData and OnSeek
  # virtual functions may sometimes be called from this separate thread.
  # It is important to keep this in mind, because you may have to take
  # care of synchronization issues if you share data between threads.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # class CustomStream < SF::SoundStream
  #   def initialize(location : String)
  #     # Open the source and get audio settings
  #     # [...]
  #
  #     # Initialize the stream -- important!

  #   end
  #
  #   def on_get_data()
  #     # Return a slice with audio data from the stream source
  #     # (note: must not be empty if you want to continue playing)

  #   end
  #

  # Streamed music played from an audio file
  #
  # Musics are sounds that are streamed rather than completely
  # loaded in memory. This is especially useful for compressed
  # musics that usually take hundreds of MB when they are
  # uncompressed: by streaming it instead of loading it entirely,
  # you avoid saturating the memory and have almost no loading delay.
  # This implies that the underlying resource (file, stream or
  # memory buffer) must remain valid for the lifetime of the
  # `SF::Music` object.
  #
  # Apart from that, a `SF::Music` has almost the same features as
  # the `SF::SoundBuffer` / `SF::Sound` pair: you can play/pause/stop
  # it, request its parameters (channels, sample rate), change
  # the way it is played (pitch, volume, 3D position, ...), etc.
  #
  # As a sound stream, a music is played in its own thread in order
  # not to block the rest of the program. This means that you can
  # leave the music alone after calling `play()`, it will manage itself
  # very well.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # # Declare a new music
  # music = SF::Music.new
  #
  # # Open it from an audio file
  # if !music.open_from_file("music.ogg")
  #     # error...
  # end
  #
  # # Change some parameters
  # music.set_position(0, 1, 10) # change its 3D position
  # music.pitch = 2              # increase the pitch
  # music.volume = 50            # reduce the volume
  # music.loop = true            # make it loop
  #
  # # Play it
  # music.play()

  # Regular sound that can be played in the audio environment
  #
  # `SF::Sound` is the class to use to play sounds.
  # It provides:
  #
  # * Control (play, pause, stop)
  # * Ability to modify output parameters in real-time (pitch, volume, ...)
  # * 3D spatial features (position, attenuation, ...).
  #
  # `SF::Sound` is perfect for playing short sounds that can
  # fit in memory and require no latency, like foot steps or
  # gun shots. For longer sounds, like background musics
  # or long speeches, rather see `SF::Music` (which is based
  # on streaming).
  #
  # In order to work, a sound must be given a buffer of audio
  # data to play. Audio data (samples) is stored in `SF::SoundBuffer`,
  # and attached to a sound with the `buffer=()` function.
  # The buffer object attached to a sound must remain alive
  # as long as the sound uses it. Note that multiple sounds
  # can use the same sound buffer at the same time.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # buffer = SF::SoundBuffer.from_file("sound.wav")
  #
  # sound = SF::Sound.new
  # sound.buffer = buffer
  # sound.play()

  # Storage for audio samples defining a sound
  #
  # A sound buffer holds the data of a sound, which is
  # an array of audio samples. A sample is a 16 bits signed integer
  # that defines the amplitude of the sound at a given time.
  # The sound is then reconstituted by playing these samples at
  # a high rate (for example, 44100 samples per second is the
  # standard rate used for playing CDs). In short, audio samples
  # are like texture pixels, and a `SF::SoundBuffer` is similar to
  # a `SF::Texture`.
  #
  # A sound buffer can be loaded from a file (see `load_from_file()`
  # for the complete list of supported formats), from memory, from
  # a custom stream (see `SF::InputStream`) or directly from an array
  # of samples. It can also be saved back to a file.
  #
  # Sound buffers alone are not very useful: they hold the audio data
  # but cannot be played. To do so, you need to use the `SF::Sound` class,
  # which provides functions to play/pause/stop the sound as well as
  # changing the way it is outputted (volume, pitch, 3D position, ...).
  # This separation allows more flexibility and better performances:
  # indeed a `SF::SoundBuffer` is a heavy resource, and any operation on it
  # is slow (often too slow for real-time applications). On the other
  # side, a `SF::Sound` is a lightweight object, which can use the audio data
  # of a sound buffer and change the way it is played without actually
  # modifying that data. Note that it is also possible to bind
  # several `SF::Sound` instances to the same `SF::SoundBuffer`.
  #
  # It is important to note that the `SF::Sound` instance doesn't
  # copy the buffer that it uses, it only keeps a reference to it.
  # Thus, a `SF::SoundBuffer` must not be destructed while it is
  # used by a `SF::Sound` (i.e. never write a function that
  # uses a local `SF::SoundBuffer` instance for loading a sound).
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # # Load a new sound buffer from a file
  # buffer = SF::SoundBuffer.from_file("sound.wav")
  #
  # # Create a sound source and bind it to the buffer
  # sound1 = SF::Sound.new
  # sound1.buffer = buffer
  #
  # # Play the sound
  # sound1.play()
  #
  # # Create another sound source bound to the same buffer
  # sound2 = SF::Sound.new
  # sound2.buffer = buffer
  #
  # # Play it with a higher pitch -- the first sound remains unchanged
  # sound2.pitch = 2
  # sound2.play()
  # ```

  # Abstract base class for capturing sound data
  #
  # `SF::SoundBuffer` provides a simple interface to access
  # the audio recording capabilities of the computer
  # (the microphone). As an abstract base class, it only cares
  # about capturing sound samples, the task of making something
  # useful with them is left to the derived class. Note that
  # SFML provides a built-in specialization for saving the
  # captured data to a sound buffer (see `SF::SoundBufferRecorder`).
  #
  # A derived class has only one virtual function to override:
  #
  # * on_process_samples provides the new chunks of audio samples while the capture happens
  #
  # Moreover, two additional virtual functions can be overridden
  # as well if necessary:
  #
  # * `on_start` is called before the capture happens, to perform custom initializations
  # * `on_stop` is called after the capture ends, to perform custom cleanup
  #
  # A derived class can also control the frequency of the on_process_samples
  # calls, with the `processing_interval=` protected function. The default
  # interval is chosen so that recording thread doesn't consume too much
  # CPU, but it can be changed to a smaller value if you need to process
  # the recorded data in real time, for example.
  #
  # The audio capture feature may not be supported or activated
  # on every platform, thus it is recommended to check its
  # availability with the `available?()` function. If it returns
  # false, then any attempt to use an audio recorder will fail.
  #
  # If you have multiple sound input devices connected to your
  # computer (for example: microphone, external soundcard, webcam mic, ...)
  # you can get a list of all available devices through the
  # available_devices() function. You can then select a device
  # by calling `device=()` with the appropriate device. Otherwise
  # the default capturing device will be used.
  #
  # By default the recording is in 16-bit mono. Using the
  # channel_count= method you can change the number of channels
  # used by the audio capture device to record. Note that you
  # have to decide whether you want to record in mono or stereo
  # before starting the recording.
  #
  # It is important to note that the audio capture happens in a
  # separate thread, so that it doesn't block the rest of the
  # program. In particular, the on_process_samples virtual function
  # (but not on_start and not on_stop) will be called
  # from this separate thread. It is important to keep this in
  # mind, because you may have to take care of synchronization
  # issues if you share data between threads.
  # Another thing to bear in mind is that you must call `stop()`
  # in the destructor of your derived class, so that the recording
  # thread finishes before your object is destroyed.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # class CustomRecorder < SF::SoundRecorder
  #   def finalize
  #     # Make sure to stop the recording thread
  #     stop()
  #   end
  #
  #   def on_start() # optional
  #     # Initialize whatever has to be done before the capture starts
  #     # [...]
  #
  #     # Return true to start playing
  #     true
  #   end
  #
  #   def on_process_samples(samples)
  #     # Do something with the new chunk of samples (store them, send them, ...)
  #     # [...]
  #
  #     # Return true to continue playing
  #     true
  #   end
  #
  #   def on_stop() # optional
  #     # Clean up whatever has to be done after the capture ends
  #     # [...]
  #   end
  # end

  # Specialized SoundRecorder which stores the captured
  # audio data into a sound buffer
  #
  # `SF::SoundBufferRecorder` allows to access a recorded sound
  # through a `SF::SoundBuffer`, so that it can be played, saved
  # to a file, etc.
  #
  # It has the same simple interface as its base class (`start()`, `stop()`)
  # and adds a function to retrieve the recorded sound buffer
  # (`buffer()`).
  #
  # As usual, don't forget to call the `available?()` function
  # before using this class (see `SF::SoundRecorder` for more details
  # about this).
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # if SF::SoundBufferRecorder.available?
  #   # Record some audio data
  #   recorder = SF::SoundBufferRecorder.new
  #   recorder.start()
  #   # [...]
  #   recorder.stop()
  #
  #   # Get the buffer containing the captured audio data
  #   buffer = recorder.buffer
  #
  #   # Save it to a file (for example...)
  #   buffer.save_to_file("my_record.ogg")
  # end
  # ```
