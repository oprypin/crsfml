  # Represents a time value
  #
  # `SF::Time` encapsulates a time value in a flexible way.
  # It allows to define a time value either as a number of
  # seconds, milliseconds or microseconds. It also works the
  # other way round: you can read a time value as either
  # a number of seconds, milliseconds or microseconds.
  #
  # By using such a flexible interface, the API doesn't
  # impose any fixed type or resolution for time values,
  # and let the user choose its own favorite representation.
  #
  # Time values support the usual mathematical operations:
  # you can add or subtract two times, multiply or divide
  # a time by a number, compare two times, etc.
  #
  # Since they represent a time span and not an absolute time
  # value, times can also be negative.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # t1 = SF.seconds(0.1)
  # milli = t1.as_milliseconds # 100
  #
  # t2 = SF.milliseconds(30)
  # micro = t2.as_microseconds # 30000
  #
  # t3 = SF.microseconds(-800000)
  # sec = t3.as_seconds # -0.8
  # ```
  #
  # ```crystal
  # def update(elapsed : SF::Time)
  #   @position += @speed * elapsed.as_seconds
  # end
  #
  # update(SF.milliseconds(100))
  # ```

  # Abstract class for custom file input streams
  #
  # This class allows users to define their own file input sources
  # from which SFML can load resources.
  #
  # SFML resource classes like `SF::Texture` and
  # `SF::SoundBuffer` provide load_from_file and load_from_memory functions,
  # which read data from conventional sources. However, if you
  # have data coming from a different source (over a network,
  # embedded, encrypted, compressed, etc) you can derive your
  # own class from `SF::InputStream` and load SFML resources with
  # their load_from_stream function.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # # custom stream class that reads from inside a zip file
  # class ZipStream < SF::InputStream
  #     def initialize(archive : String)
  #
  #     def open(filename : String)
  #
  #     def read(data : Slice) : Int64
  #
  #     def seek(position : Int) : Int64
  #
  #     def tell : Int64
  #
  #     def size : Int64
  #
  #     # [...]
  # end
  #
  # # now you can load textures...
  # stream = ZipStream.new("resources.zip")
  # stream.open("images/img.png")
  # texture = SF::Texture.from_stream(stream)
  #
  # # musics...
  # stream = ZipStream.new("resources.zip")
  # stream.open("musics/msc.ogg")
  # music = SF::Music.from_stream(stream)
  #
  # # etc.

  # Blocks concurrent access to shared resources
  # from multiple threads
  #
  # Mutex stands for "MUTual EXclusion". A mutex is a
  # synchronization object, used when multiple threads are involved.
  #
  # When you want to protect a part of the code from being accessed
  # simultaneously by multiple threads, you typically use a
  # mutex. When a thread is locked by a mutex, any other thread
  # trying to lock it will be blocked until the mutex is released
  # by the thread that locked it. This way, you can allow only
  # one thread at a time to access a critical region of your code.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # @database = Database.new # this is a critical resource that needs some protection
  # @mutex = SF::Mutex.new
  #
  # def thread1()
  #   @mutex.lock() # this call will block the thread if the mutex is already locked by thread2
  #   @database.write(...)
  #   @mutex.unlock() # if thread2 was waiting, it will now be unblocked
  # end
  #
  # def thread2()
  #   @mutex.lock() # this call will block the thread if the mutex is already locked by thread1
  #   @database.write(...)
  #   @mutex.unlock() # if thread1 was waiting, it will now be unblocked
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # Be very careful with mutexes. A bad usage can lead to bad problems,
  # like deadlocks (two threads are waiting for each other and the
  # application is globally stuck).
  #
  # To make the usage of mutexes more robust, particularly in
  # environments where exceptions can be thrown, you should
  # use the helper method `synchronize` to lock/unlock mutexes.
  #
  # SFML mutexes are recursive, which means that you can lock
  # a mutex multiple times in the same thread without creating
  # a deadlock. In this case, the first call to `lock()` behaves
  # as usual, and the following ones have no effect.
  # However, you must call `unlock()` exactly as many times as you
  # called `lock()`. If you don't, the mutex won't be released.
  # However, you must call unlock() exactly as many times as you
  # called lock(). If you don't, the mutex won't be released.

  # Utility class to manipulate threads
  #
  # Threads provide a way to run multiple parts of the code
  # in parallel. When you launch a new thread, the execution
  # is split and both the new thread and the caller run
  # in parallel.
  #
  # To use a `SF::Thread`, you construct it directly with the
  # function to execute as the entry point of the thread.
  # `SF::Thread` has multiple template constructors, which means
  # that you can use several types of entry points:
  #
  # * non-member functions with no argument
  # * non-member functions with one argument of any type
  # * functors with no argument (this one is particularly useful for compatibility with boost/std::%bind)
  # * functors with one argument of any type
  # * member functions from any class with no argument
  #
  # The function argument, if any, is copied in the `SF::Thread`
  # instance, as well as the functor (if the corresponding
  # constructor is used). Class instances, however, are passed
  # by pointer so you must make sure that the object won't be
  # destroyed while the thread is still using it.
  #
  # The thread ends when its function is terminated. If the
  # owner `SF::Thread` instance is destroyed before the
  # thread is finished, the destructor will wait (see `wait()`)
  #
  # Usage examples:
  # ```c++
  # # example 1: non member function with one argument
  #
  # void threadFunc(int argument)
  #     // [...]
  # end
  #
  # thread = SF::Thread.new(&threadFunc, 5)
  # thread.launch() # start the thread (internally calls threadFunc(5))
  # ```
  #
  # ```c++
  # # example 2: member function
  #
  # class Task
  # public:
  #     void run()
  #         // [...]
  #     end
  # end
  #
  # Task task
  # thread = SF::Thread.new(&Task.run, &task)
  # thread.launch() # start the thread (internally calls task.run())
  # ```
  #
  # ```c++
  # # example 3: functor
  #
  # struct Task
  #     void operator()()
  #         // [...]
  #     end
  # end
  #
  # thread = SF::Thread.new(Task())
  # thread.launch() # start the thread (internally calls operator() on the Task instance)
  # ```
  #
  # Creating parallel threads of execution can be dangerous:
  # all threads inside the same process share the same memory space,
  # which means that you may end up accessing the same variable
  # from multiple threads at the same time. To prevent this
  # kind of situations, you can use mutexes (see `SF::Mutex`).
  #
  # *See also:* `SF::Mutex`
  class Thread
    @this : Void*
    # Construct the thread from a functor with an argument
    #
    # This constructor works for function objects, as well
    # as free functions.
    # It is a template, which means that the argument can
    # have any type (int, std::string, void*, Toto, ...).
    #
    # Use this constructor for this kind of function:
    # ```c++
    # void function(int arg)
    #
    # # --- or ----
    #
    # struct Functor
    #     void operator()(std::string arg)
