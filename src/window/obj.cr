  #
  # `SF::Clipboard` provides an interface for getting and

  #
  # It is important to note that due to limitations on some
  # operating systems, setting the clipboard contents is
  # only guaranteed to work if there is currently an open
  # window for which events are being handled.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```c++
  # // get the clipboard content as a string
  # sf::String string = sf::Clipboard::getString();
  #
  # // or use it in the event loop
  # sf::Event event;
  # while(window.pollEvent(event))
  # {
  #     if(event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
  #         window.close();
  #     if(event.type == sf::Event::KeyPressed)
  #     {
  #         // Using Ctrl + V to paste a string into SFML
  #         if(event.key.control && event.key.code == sf::Keyboard::V)
  #             string = sf::Clipboard::getString();

  # Structure defining the settings of the OpenGL
  # context attached to a window
  #
  # ContextSettings allows to define several advanced settings
  # of the OpenGL context attached to a window. All these
  # settings with the exception of the compatibility flag
  # and anti-aliasing level have no impact on the regular
  # SFML rendering (graphics module), so you may need to use
  # this structure only if you're using SFML as a windowing
  # system for custom OpenGL rendering.
  #
  # The depth_bits and stencil_bits members define the number
  # of bits per pixel requested for the (respectively) depth
  # and stencil buffers.
  #
  # antialiasing_level represents the requested number of
  # multisampling levels for anti-aliasing.
  #
  # major_version and minor_version define the version of the
  # OpenGL context that you want. Only versions greater or
  # equal to 3.0 are relevant; versions lesser than 3.0 are
  # all handled the same way (i.e. you can use any version
  # &lt; 3.0 if you don't want an OpenGL 3 context).
  #
  # When requesting a context with a version greater or equal
  # to 3.2, you have the option of specifying whether the
  # context should follow the core or compatibility profile
  # of all newer (>= 3.2) OpenGL specifications. For versions 3.0
  # and 3.1 there is only the core profile. By default a
  # compatibility context is created. You only need to specify
  # the core flag if you want a core profile context to use with
  # your own OpenGL rendering.
  #
  # WARNING: The graphics module will not function if you
  # request a core profile context. Make sure the attributes are
  # set to Default if you want to use the graphics module.
  #
  # Setting the debug attribute flag will request a context with
  # additional debugging features enabled. Depending on the
  # system, this might be required for advanced OpenGL debugging.
  # OpenGL debugging is disabled by default.
  #
  # **Special Note for OS X:**
  # Apple only supports choosing between either a legacy context
  # (OpenGL 2.1) or a core context (OpenGL version depends on the
  # operating system version but is at least 3.2). Compatibility
  # contexts are not supported. Further information is available on the
  # [OpenGL Capabilities Tables](https://developer.apple.com/opengl/capabilities/index.html)
  # page. OS X also currently does not support debug contexts.
  #
  # Please note that these values are only a hint.
  # No failure will be reported if one or more of these values
  # are not supported by the system; instead, SFML will try to
  # find the closest valid match. You can then retrieve the
  # settings that the window actually used to create its context,
  # with Window.settings().

  # Class holding a valid drawing context
  #
  # If you need to make OpenGL calls without having an
  # active window (like in a thread), you can use an
  # instance of this class to get a valid context.
  #
  # Having a valid context is necessary for *every* OpenGL call.

  # Note that a context is only active in its current thread,
  # if you create a new thread it will have no valid context
  # by default.
  #
  # To use a `SF::Context` instance, just construct it and let it
  # live as long as you need a valid context. No explicit activation
  # is needed, all it has to do is to exist. Its destructor
  # will take care of deactivating and freeing all the attached
  # resources.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```c++
  # void threadFunction(void*)
  #    SF::Context context
  #    # from now on, you have a valid context
  #
  #    # you can make OpenGL calls
  #    glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)

  # # the context is automatically deactivated and destroyed

  # Give access to the real-time state of the joysticks
  #
  # `SF::Joystick` provides an interface to the state of the
  # joysticks. It only contains static functions, so it's not
  # meant to be instantiated. Instead, each joystick is identified
  # by an index that is passed to the functions of this module.
  #
  # This module allows users to query the state of joysticks at any
  # time and directly, without having to deal with a window and
  # its events. Compared to the `JoystickMoved`, `JoystickButtonPressed`
  # and `JoystickButtonReleased` events, `SF::Joystick` can retrieve the
  # state of axes and buttons of joysticks at any time
  # (you don't need to store and update a boolean on your side
  # in order to know if a button is pressed or released), and you
  # always get the real state of joysticks, even if they are
  # moved, pressed or released when your window is out of focus
  # and no event is triggered.
  #
  # SFML supports:
  #
  # * 8 joysticks (`SF::Joystick::Count`)
  # * 32 buttons per joystick (`SF::Joystick::ButtonCount`)
  # * 8 axes per joystick (`SF::Joystick::AxisCount`)
  #
  # Unlike the keyboard or mouse, the state of joysticks is sometimes
  # not directly available (depending on the OS), therefore an `update()`
  # function must be called in order to update the current state of
  # joysticks. When you have a window with event handling, this is done
  # automatically, you don't need to call anything. But if you have no
  # window, or if you want to check joysticks state before creating one,
  # you must call `SF::Joystick.update` explicitly.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # # Is joystick #0 connected?
  # connected = SF::Joystick.connected?(0)
  #
  # # How many buttons does joystick #0 support?
  # buttons = SF::Joystick.get_button_count(0)
  #
  # # Does joystick #0 define a X axis?
  # has_x = SF::Joystick.axis?(0, SF::Joystick::X)
  #
  # # Is button #2 pressed on joystick #0?
  # pressed = SF::Joystick.button_pressed?(0, 2)
  #
  # # What's the current position of the Y axis on joystick #0?
  # position = SF::Joystick.get_axis_position(0, SF::Joystick::Y)
  # ```

  # Give access to the real-time state of the sensors
  #
  # `SF::Sensor` provides an interface to the state of the

  # functions, so it's not meant to be instantiated.
  #
  # This module allows users to query the sensors values at any
  # time and directly, without having to deal with a window and
  # its events. Compared to the `Event::SensorChanged` event, `SF::Sensor`
  # can retrieve the state of a sensor at any time (you don't need to
  # store and update its current value on your side).
  #
  # Depending on the OS and hardware of the device (phone, tablet, ...),
  # some sensor types may not be available. You should always check
  # the availability of a sensor before trying to read it, with the
  # `SF::Sensor.available?` function.
  #
  # You may wonder why some sensor types look so similar, for example
  # `Type::Accelerometer` and `Type::Gravity` / `Type::UserAcceleration`. The first one
  # is the raw measurement of the acceleration, and takes into account
  # both the earth gravity and the user movement. The others are
  # more precise: they provide these components separately, which is
  # usually more useful. In fact they are not direct sensors, they
  # are computed internally based on the raw acceleration and other sensors.
  # This is exactly the same for Gyroscope vs Orientation.
  #
  # Because sensors consume a non-negligible amount of current, they are
  # all disabled by default. You must call `SF::Sensor.set_enabled` for each
  # sensor in which you are interested.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # if SF::Sensor.available?(SF::Sensor::Gravity)
  #   # gravity sensor is available

  #
  # A `SF::Event` instance contains the type of the event
  # (mouse moved, key pressed, window closed, ...) as well

  # only the member matching the type of the event will be properly
  # filled; all other members will have undefined values and must not
  # be read if the type of the event doesn't match. For example,
  # if you received a KeyPressed event, then you must read the
  # event.key member, all other members such as event.mouse_move
  # or event.text will have undefined values.

  # Give access to the real-time state of the touches
  #
  # `SF::Touch` provides an interface to the state of the
  # touches. It only contains static functions, so it's not
  # meant to be instantiated.
  #
  # This module allows users to query the touches state at any
  # time and directly, without having to deal with a window and
  # its events. Compared to the `TouchBegan`, `TouchMoved`
  # and `TouchEnded` events, `SF::Touch` can retrieve the
  # state of the touches at any time (you don't need to store and
  # update a boolean on your side in order to know if a touch is down),
  # and you always get the real state of the touches, even if they
  # happen when your window is out of focus and no event is triggered.
  #
  # The position function can be used to retrieve the current
  # position of a touch. There are two versions: one that operates
  # in global coordinates (relative to the desktop) and one that
  # operates in window coordinates (relative to a specific window).
  #
  # Touches are identified by an index (the "finger"), so that in
  # multi-touch events, individual touches can be tracked correctly.
  # As long as a finger touches the screen, it will keep the same index
  # even if other fingers start or stop touching the screen in the
  # meantime. As a consequence, active touch indices may not always be
  # sequential (i.e. touch number 0 may be released while touch number 1
  # is still down).
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # if SF::Touch.down?(0)
  #   # touch 0 is down
  # end
  #
  # # get global position of touch 1
  # global_pos = SF::Touch.get_position(1)
  #
  # # get position of touch 1 relative to a window
  # relative_pos = SF::Touch.get_position(1, window)

  # VideoMode defines a video mode (width, height, bpp)
  #
  # A video mode is defined by a width and a height (in pixels)
  # and a depth (in bits per pixel). Video modes are used to
  # setup windows (`SF::Window`) at creation time.
  #
  # The main usage of video modes is for fullscreen mode:
  # indeed you must use one of the valid video modes
  # allowed by the OS (which are defined by what the monitor
  # and the graphics card support), otherwise your window
  # creation will just fail.
  #
  # `SF::VideoMode` provides a static function for retrieving
  # the list of all the video modes supported by the system:
  # `fullscreen_modes()`.
  #
  # A custom video mode can also be checked directly for
  # fullscreen compatibility with its `valid?()` function.
  #
  # Additionally, `SF::VideoMode` provides a static function
  # to get the mode currently used by the desktop: `desktop_mode()`.
  # This allows to build windows with the same size or pixel
  # depth as the current resolution.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # # Display the list of all the video modes available for fullscreen
  # SF::VideoMode.fullscreen_modes.each do |mode|
  #   puts "Mode ##{i}: #{mode.width}x#{mode.height} - #{mode.bits_per_pixel} bpp"
  # end

  # desktop = SF::VideoMode.desktop_mode
  # window.create(SF::VideoMode.new(1024, 768, desktop.bits_per_pixel), "SFML window")

  # Window that serves as a target for OpenGL rendering
  #
  # `SF::Window` is the main class of the Window module. It defines
  # an OS window that is able to receive an OpenGL rendering.
  #
  # A `SF::Window` can create its own new window, or be embedded into
  # an already existing control using the create(handle) function.
  # This can be useful for embedding an OpenGL rendering area into
  # a view which is part of a bigger GUI with existing windows,
  # controls, etc. It can also serve as embedding an OpenGL rendering
  # area into a window created by another (probably richer) GUI library
  # like Qt or wx_widgets.
  #
  # The `SF::Window` class provides a simple interface for manipulating
  # the window: move, resize, show/hide, control mouse cursor, etc.
  # It also provides event handling through its `poll_event()` and wait_event()
  # functions.
  #
  # Note that OpenGL experts can pass their own parameters (antialiasing
  # level, bits for the depth and stencil buffers, etc.) to the
  # OpenGL context attached to the window, with the `SF::ContextSettings`
  # structure which is passed as an optional argument when creating the
  # window.
  #
  # On dual-graphics systems consisting of a low-power integrated GPU
  # and a powerful discrete GPU, the driver picks which GPU will run an
  # SFML application. In order to inform the driver that an SFML application
  # can benefit from being run on the more powerful discrete GPU,
  # #SFML_DEFINE_DISCRETE_GPU_PREFERENCE can be placed in a source file
  # that is compiled and linked into the final application. The macro
  # should be placed outside of any scopes in the global namespace.
  #
  # Usage example:
  # ```crystal
  # # Declare and create a new window
  # window = SF::Window.new(SF::VideoMode.new(800, 600), "SFML window")
  #
  # # Limit the framerate to 60 frames per second (this step is optional)
  # window.framerate_limit = 60
  #
  # # The main loop - ends as soon as the window is closed
  # while window.open?
  #   # Event processing
  #   while (event = window.poll_event)
  #     # Request for closing the window
  #     if event.is_a?(SF::Event::Closed)
  #       window.close()
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   # Activate the window for OpenGL rendering
  #   window.active = true
  #
  #   # OpenGL drawing commands go here...
  #
  #   # End the current frame and display its contents on screen
  #   window.display()
  # end
