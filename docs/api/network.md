# SF::Ftp

A FTP client

`SF::Ftp` is a very simple FTP client that allows you
to communicate with a FTP server. The FTP protocol allows
you to manipulate a remote file system (list files,
upload, download, create, remove, ...).

Using the FTP client consists of 4 parts:

* Connecting to the FTP server
* Logging in (either as a registered user or anonymously)
* Sending commands to the server
* Disconnecting (this part can be done implicitly by the destructor)

Every command returns a FTP response, which contains the
status code as well as a message from the server. Some
commands such as `working_directory()` and directory_listing()
return additional data, and use a class derived from
`SF::Ftp::Response` to provide this data. The most often used
commands are directly provided as member functions, but it is
also possible to use specific commands with the `send_command()` function.

Note that response statuses &gt;= 1000 are not part of the FTP standard,
they are generated by SFML when an internal error occurs.

All commands, especially upload and download, may take some
time to complete. This is important to know if you don't want
to block your application while the server is completing
the task.

Usage example:
```
# Create a new FTP client
ftp = SF::Ftp.new

# Connect to the server
response = ftp.connect("ftp://ftp.myserver.com")
if response.ok?
  puts "Connected"
end

# Log in
response = ftp.login("laurent", "dF6Zm89D")
if response.ok?
  puts "Logged in"
end

# Print the working directory
directory = ftp.working_directory()
if directory.ok?
  puts "Working directory: #{directory.directory}"
end

# Create a new directory
response = ftp.create_directory "files"
if response.ok?
  puts "Created new directory"
end

# Upload a file to this new directory
response = ftp.upload("local-path/file.txt", "files", SF::Ftp::Ascii)
if response.ok?)
  puts "File uploaded"
end

# Send specific commands (here: FEAT to list supported FTP features)
response = ftp.send_command "FEAT"
if response.ok?
  puts "Feature list:\n#{response.message}"
end

# Disconnect from the server
ftp.disconnect()
```

# SF::Http

A HTTP client

`SF::Http` is a very simple HTTP client that allows you
to communicate with a web server. You can retrieve
web pages, send data to an interactive resource,
download a remote file, etc. The HTTPS protocol is
not supported.

The HTTP client is split into 3 classes:

* `SF::Http::Request`
* `SF::Http::Response`
* `SF::Http`

`SF::Http::Request` builds the request that will be
sent to the server. A request is made of:

* a method (what you want to do)
* a target URI (usually the name of the web page or file)
* one or more header fields (options that you can pass to the server)
* an optional body (for POST requests)

`SF::Http::Response` parse the response from the web server
and provides getters to read them. The response contains:

* a status code
* header fields (that may be answers to the ones that you requested)
* a body, which contains the contents of the requested resource

`SF::Http` provides a simple function, SendRequest, to send a
`SF::Http::Request` and return the corresponding `SF::Http::Response`
from the server.

Usage example:
```
# Create a new HTTP client
http = SF::Http.new("http://www.sfml-dev.org")

# Prepare a request to get the 'features.php' page
request = SF::Http::Request.new("features.php")

# Send the request
response = http.send_request request

# Check the status code and display the result
SF::Http::Response::Status status = response.getStatus()
if response.status == SF::Http::Response::Ok
    puts response.body
else
    puts "Error #{response.status}"
end
```

## SF::Http#initialize()

Default constructor

## SF::Http#initialize(host,port)

Construct the HTTP client with the target host

This is equivalent to calling host=(host, port).
The port has a default value of 0, which means that the
HTTP client will use the right port according to the
protocol used (80 for HTTP). You should leave it like
this unless you really need a port other than the
standard one, or use an unknown protocol.

* *host* - Web server to connect to
* *port* - Port to use for connection

## SF::Http#send_request(request,timeout)

Send a HTTP request and return the server's response.

You must have a valid host before sending a request (see host=).
Any missing mandatory header field in the request will be added
with an appropriate value.

WARNING: This function waits for the server's response and may
not return instantly; use a thread if you don't want to block your
application, or use a timeout to limit the time to wait. A value
of Time::Zero means that the client will use the system default timeout
(which is usually pretty long).

* *request* - Request to send
* *timeout* - Maximum time to wait

*Returns:* Server's response

## SF::Http#set_host(host,port)

Set the target host

This function just stores the host address and port, it
doesn't actually connect to it until you send a request.
The port has a default value of 0, which means that the
HTTP client will use the right port according to the
protocol used (80 for HTTP). You should leave it like
this unless you really need a port other than the
standard one, or use an unknown protocol.

* *host* - Web server to connect to
* *port* - Port to use for connection

# SF::IpAddress

Encapsulate an IPv4 network address

`SF::IpAddress` is a utility class for manipulating network
addresses. It provides a set a implicit constructors and
conversion functions to easily build or transform an IP
address from/to various representations.

Usage example:
```
a0 = SF::IpAddress.new                    # an invalid address
a1 = SF::IpAddress::None                  # an invalid address (same as a0)
a2 = SF::IpAddress.new("127.0.0.1")       # the local host address
a3 = SF::IpAddress::Broadcast             # the broadcast address
a4 = SF::IpAddress.new(192, 168, 1, 56)   # a local address
a5 = SF::IpAddress.new("my_computer")     # a local address created from a network name
a6 = SF::IpAddress.new("89.54.1.169")     # a distant address
a7 = SF::IpAddress.new("www.google.com")  # a distant address created from a network name
a8 = SF::IpAddress.local_address          # my address on the local network
a9 = SF::IpAddress.get_public_address()   # my address on the internet
```

Note that `SF::IpAddress` currently doesn't support IPv6
nor other types of network addresses.

## SF::IpAddress.get_public_address(timeout)

Get the computer's public address

The public address is the address of the computer from the
internet point of view, i.e. something like 89.54.1.169.
It is necessary for communications over the world wide web.
The only way to get a public address is to ask it to a
distant website; as a consequence, this function depends on
both your network connection and the server, and may be
very slow. You should use it as few as possible. Because
this function depends on the network connection and on a distant
server, you may use a time limit if you don't want your program
to be possibly stuck waiting in case there is a problem; this
limit is deactivated by default.

* *timeout* - Maximum time to wait

*Returns:* Public IP address of the computer

*See also:* `local_address`

## SF::IpAddress#initialize()

Default constructor

This constructor creates an empty (invalid) address

## SF::IpAddress#initialize(address)

Construct the address from a string

Here *address* can be either a decimal address
(ex: "192.168.1.56") or a network name (ex: "localhost").

* *address* - IP address or network name

## SF::IpAddress#initialize(address)

Construct the address from a string

Here *address* can be either a decimal address
(ex: "192.168.1.56") or a network name (ex: "localhost").
This is equivalent to the constructor taking a std::string
parameter, it is defined for convenience so that the
implicit conversions from literal strings to IpAddress work.

* *address* - IP address or network name

## SF::IpAddress#initialize(address)

Construct the address from a 32-bits integer

This constructor uses the internal representation of
the address directly. It should be used for optimization
purposes, and only if you got that representation from
IpAddress.to_integer().

* *address* - 4 bytes of the address packed into a 32-bits integer

*See also:* `to_integer`

## SF::IpAddress#initialize(byte0,byte1,byte2,byte3)

Construct the address from 4 bytes

Calling IpAddress(a, b, c, d) is equivalent to calling
IpAddress("a.b.c.d"), but safer as it doesn't have to
parse a string to get the address components.

* *byte0* - First byte of the address
* *byte1* - Second byte of the address
* *byte2* - Third byte of the address
* *byte3* - Fourth byte of the address

## SF::IpAddress#initialize(copy)

:nodoc:

## SF::IpAddress.local_address()

Get the computer's local address

The local address is the address of the computer from the
LAN point of view, i.e. something like 192.168.1.56. It is
meaningful only for communications over the local network.
Unlike public_address, this function is fast and may be
used safely anywhere.

*Returns:* Local IP address of the computer

*See also:* `public_address`

## SF::IpAddress#==(right)

Overload of == operator to compare two IP addresses

* *left* - Left operand (a IP address)
* *right* - Right operand (a IP address)

*Returns:* True if both addresses are equal

## SF::IpAddress#!=(right)

Overload of != operator to compare two IP addresses

* *left* - Left operand (a IP address)
* *right* - Right operand (a IP address)

*Returns:* True if both addresses are different

## SF::IpAddress#<(right)

Overload of &lt; operator to compare two IP addresses

* *left* - Left operand (a IP address)
* *right* - Right operand (a IP address)

*Returns:* True if *left* is lesser than *right*

## SF::IpAddress#>(right)

Overload of &gt; operator to compare two IP addresses

* *left* - Left operand (a IP address)
* *right* - Right operand (a IP address)

*Returns:* True if *left* is greater than *right*

## SF::IpAddress#<=(right)

Overload of &lt;= operator to compare two IP addresses

* *left* - Left operand (a IP address)
* *right* - Right operand (a IP address)

*Returns:* True if *left* is lesser or equal than *right*

## SF::IpAddress#>=(right)

Overload of &gt;= operator to compare two IP addresses

* *left* - Left operand (a IP address)
* *right* - Right operand (a IP address)

*Returns:* True if *left* is greater or equal than *right*

## SF::IpAddress#to_integer()

Get an integer representation of the address

The returned number is the internal representation of the
address, and should be used for optimization purposes only
(like sending the address through a socket).
The integer produced by this function can then be converted
back to a `SF::IpAddress` with the proper constructor.

*Returns:* 32-bits unsigned integer representation of the address

*See also:* `to_s`

## SF::IpAddress#to_s()

Get a string representation of the address

The returned string is the decimal representation of the
IP address (like "192.168.1.56"), even if it was constructed
from a host name.

*Returns:* String representation of the address

*See also:* `to_integer`

# SF::Packet

Utility class to build blocks of data to transfer
over the network

Packets provide a safe and easy way to serialize data,
in order to send it over the network using sockets
(`SF::TcpSocket`, `SF::UdpSocket`).

Packets solve 2 fundamental problems that arise when
transferring data over the network:

* data is interpreted correctly according to the endianness
* the bounds of the packet are preserved (one send == one receive)

The `SF::Packet` class provides both input and output, using `read`
and `write` methods.

It is recommended to use only fixed-size types (like `Int32`, etc.),
to avoid possible differences between the sender and the receiver.

Usage example:
```
x = 24u32
s = "hello"
d = 5.89

# Group the variables to send into a packet
packet = SF::Packet.new
packet.write x
packet.write s
packet.write d

# Send it over the network (socket is a valid SF::TcpSocket)
socket.send packet

-----------------------------------------------------------------

# Receive the packet at the other end
packet = SF::Packet.new
socket.receive(packet)

# Extract the variables contained in the packet
x = packet.read UInt32
s = packet.read String
d = packet.read Float64
if packet.valid?
  # Data extracted successfully...
end
```

Packets have overloads of `read` and `write` methods for standard types:

* Bool
* Fixed-size integer types (`Int8/16/32/64`, `UInt8/16/32/64`)
* Floating point numbers (`Float32/64`)
* `String`

Like standard streams, it is also possible to define your own overloads
of these methods in order to handle your custom types.

```
struct MyStruct
  number : Float32
  integer : Int8
  str : String
end

class SF::Packet
  def write(m : MyStruct)
    write m.number
    write m.integer
    write m.str
  end

  def read(type : MyStruct.class) : MyStruct
    MyStruct.new(packet.read(Float32), packet.read(Int8), packet.read(String))
  end
end
```

## SF::Packet#append(data)

Append data to the end of the packet

* *data* - Pointer to the sequence of bytes to append
* *size_in_bytes* - Number of bytes to append

*See also:* `clear`

## SF::Packet#clear()

Clear the packet

After calling Clear, the packet is empty.

*See also:* `append`

## SF::Packet#data()

Get a pointer to the data contained in the packet

WARNING: The returned pointer may become invalid after
you append data to the packet, therefore it should never
be stored.
The return pointer is NULL if the packet is empty.

*Returns:* Pointer to the data

*See also:* `data_size`

## SF::Packet#data_size()

Get the size of the data contained in the packet

This function returns the number of bytes pointed to by
what data returns.

*Returns:* Data size, in bytes

*See also:* `data`

## SF::Packet#end_of_packet()

Tell if the reading position has reached the
end of the packet

This function is useful to know if there is some data
left to be read, without actually reading it.

*Returns:* True if all data was read, false otherwise

*See also:* `operator` `bool`

## SF::Packet#finalize()

## SF::Packet#valid?()

Test the validity of the packet, for reading

This operator allows to test the packet as a boolean
variable, to check if a reading operation was successful.

A packet will be in an invalid state if it has no more
data to read.

This behavior is the same as standard C++ streams.

Usage example:
```
x = packet.read(Float32)
if packet.valid?
   # ok, x was extracted successfully

# SF::Socket

Base class for all the socket types

This class mainly defines internal stuff to be used by
derived classes.

The only public features that it defines, and which
is therefore common to all the socket classes, is the
blocking state. All sockets can be set as blocking or
non-blocking.

In blocking mode, socket functions will hang until
the operation completes, which means that the entire
program (well, in fact the current thread if you use
multiple ones) will be stuck waiting for your socket
operation to complete.

In non-blocking mode, all the socket functions will
return immediately. If the socket is not ready to complete
the requested operation, the function simply returns
the proper status code (Socket::NotReady).

The default mode, which is blocking, is the one that is
generally used, in combination with threads or selectors.
The non-blocking mode is rather used in real-time
applications that run an endless loop that can poll
the socket often enough, and cannot afford blocking
this loop.

*See also:* `SF::TcpListener`, `SF::TcpSocket`, `SF::UdpSocket`

## SF::Socket::AnyPort

Special value that tells the system to pick any available port

## SF::Socket::Status

Status codes that may be returned by socket functions

### SF::Socket::Status::Disconnected

The TCP socket has been disconnected

### SF::Socket::Status::Done

The socket has sent / received the data

### SF::Socket::Status::Error

An unexpected error happened

### SF::Socket::Status::NotReady

The socket is not ready to send / receive data yet

### SF::Socket::Status::Partial

The socket sent a part of the data

## SF::Socket::Type

Types of protocols that the socket can use

### SF::Socket::Type::Tcp

TCP protocol

### SF::Socket::Type::Udp

UDP protocol

## SF::Socket#blocking?()

Tell whether the socket is in blocking or non-blocking mode

*Returns:* True if the socket is blocking, false otherwise

*See also:* `blocking=`

## SF::Socket#blocking=(blocking)

Set the blocking state of the socket

In blocking mode, calls will not return until they have
completed their task. For example, a call to Receive in
blocking mode won't return until some data was actually
received.
In non-blocking mode, calls will always return immediately,
using the return code to signal whether there was data
available or not.
By default, all sockets are blocking.

* *blocking* - True to set the socket as blocking, false for non-blocking

*See also:* `blocking?`

## SF::Socket#finalize()

Destructor

## SF::Socket#initialize(type)

Default constructor

This constructor can only be accessed by derived classes.

* *type* - Type of the socket (TCP or UDP)

# SF::SocketSelector

Multiplexer that allows to read from multiple sockets

Socket selectors provide a way to wait until some data is
available on a set of sockets, instead of just one. This
is convenient when you have multiple sockets that may
possibly receive data, but you don't know which one will
be ready first. In particular, it avoids to use a thread
for each socket; with selectors, a single thread can handle
all the sockets.

All types of sockets can be used in a selector:

* `SF::TcpListener`
* `SF::TcpSocket`
* `SF::UdpSocket`

A selector doesn't store its own copies of the sockets
(socket classes are not copyable anyway), it simply keeps
a reference to the original sockets that you pass to the
"add" function. Therefore, you can't use the selector as a
socket container, you must store them outside and make sure
that they are alive as long as they are used in the selector.

Using a selector is simple:

* populate the selector with all the sockets that you want to observe
* make it wait until there is data available on any of the sockets
* test each socket to find out which ones are ready

Usage example:
```
# Create a socket to listen to new connections
listener = SF::TcpListener.new
listener.listen(55001)

# Create an array to store the future clients
clients = [] of SF::TcpSocket

# Create a selector
selector = SF::SocketSelector.new

# Add the listener to the selector
selector.add listener

# Endless loop that waits for new connections
while running
  # Make the selector wait for data on any socket
  if selector.wait()
    # Test the listener
    if selector.ready?(listener)
      # The listener is ready: there is a pending connection
      client = SF::TcpSocket.new
      if listener.accept(client) == SF::Socket::Done
        # Add the new client to the clients list
        clients << client

        # Add the new client to the selector so that we will
        # be notified when he sends something
        selector.add client
      end
    else
      # The listener socket is not ready, test all other sockets (the clients)
      clients.each do |client|
        if selector.ready?(client)
          # The client has sent some data, we can receive it
          packet = SF::Packet.new
          if client.receive(packet) == SF::Socket::Done
              ...
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## SF::SocketSelector#add(socket)

Add a new socket to the selector

This function keeps a weak reference to the socket,
so you have to make sure that the socket is not destroyed
while it is stored in the selector.
This function does nothing if the socket is not valid.

* *socket* - Reference to the socket to add

*See also:* `remove`, `clear`

## SF::SocketSelector#clear()

Remove all the sockets stored in the selector

This function doesn't destroy any instance, it simply
removes all the references that the selector has to
external sockets.

*See also:* `add`, `remove`

## SF::SocketSelector#finalize()

Destructor

## SF::SocketSelector#initialize()

Default constructor

## SF::SocketSelector#initialize(copy)

:nodoc:

## SF::SocketSelector#ready?(socket)

Test a socket to know if it is ready to receive data

This function must be used after a call to Wait, to know
which sockets are ready to receive data. If a socket is
ready, a call to receive will never block because we know
that there is data available to read.
Note that if this function returns true for a TcpListener,
this means that it is ready to accept a new connection.

* *socket* - Socket to test

*Returns:* True if the socket is ready to read, false otherwise

*See also:* `ready?`

## SF::SocketSelector#remove(socket)

Remove a socket from the selector

This function doesn't destroy the socket, it simply
removes the reference that the selector has to it.

* *socket* - Reference to the socket to remove

*See also:* `add`, `clear`

## SF::SocketSelector#wait(timeout)

Wait until one or more sockets are ready to receive

This function returns as soon as at least one socket has
some data available to be received. To know which sockets are
ready, use the ready? function.
If you use a timeout and no socket is ready before the timeout
is over, the function returns false.

* *timeout* - Maximum time to wait, (use Time::Zero for infinity)

*Returns:* True if there are sockets ready, false otherwise

*See also:* `ready?`

# SF::TcpListener

Socket that listens to new TCP connections

A listener socket is a special type of socket that listens to
a given port and waits for connections on that port.
This is all it can do.

When a new connection is received, you must call accept and
the listener returns a new instance of `SF::TcpSocket` that
is properly initialized and can be used to communicate with
the new client.

Listener sockets are specific to the TCP protocol,
UDP sockets are connectionless and can therefore communicate
directly. As a consequence, a listener socket will always
return the new connections as `SF::TcpSocket` instances.

A listener is automatically closed on destruction, like all
other types of socket. However if you want to stop listening
before the socket is destroyed, you can call its `close()`
function.

Usage example:
```
# Create a listener socket and make it wait for new
# connections on port 55001
listener = SF::TcpListener.new
listener.listen(55001)

# Endless loop that waits for new connections
while running
  client = SF::TcpSocket.new
  if listener.accept(client) == SF::Socket::Done
    # A new client just connected!
    puts "New connection received from #{client.remote_address}"
    do_something_with client
  end
end
```

## SF::TcpListener#accept(socket)

Accept a new connection

If the socket is in blocking mode, this function will
not return until a connection is actually received.

* *socket* - Socket that will hold the new connection

*Returns:* Status code

*See also:* `listen`

## SF::TcpListener#blocking?()

:nodoc:

## SF::TcpListener#blocking=(blocking)

:nodoc:

## SF::TcpListener#close()

Stop listening and close the socket

This function gracefully stops the listener. If the
socket is not listening, this function has no effect.

*See also:* `listen`

## SF::TcpListener#initialize()

Default constructor

## SF::TcpListener#listen(port,address)

Start listening for incoming connection attempts

This function makes the socket start listening on the
specified port, waiting for incoming connection attempts.

If the socket is already listening on a port when this
function is called, it will stop listening on the old
port before starting to listen on the new port.

* *port* - Port to listen on for incoming connection attempts
* *address* - Address of the interface to listen on

*Returns:* Status code

*See also:* `accept`, `close`

## SF::TcpListener#local_port()

Get the port to which the socket is bound locally

If the socket is not listening to a port, this function
returns 0.

*Returns:* Port to which the socket is bound

*See also:* `listen`

# SF::TcpSocket

Specialized socket using the TCP protocol

TCP is a connected protocol, which means that a TCP
socket can only communicate with the host it is connected
to. It can't send or receive anything if it is not connected.

The TCP protocol is reliable but adds a slight overhead.
It ensures that your data will always be received in order
and without errors (no data corrupted, lost or duplicated).

When a socket is connected to a remote host, you can
retrieve informations about this host with the
remote_address and remote_port functions. You can
also get the local port to which the socket is bound
(which is automatically chosen when the socket is connected),
with the local_port function.

Sending and receiving data can use either the low-level
or the high-level functions. The low-level functions
process a raw sequence of bytes, and cannot ensure that
one call to Send will exactly match one call to Receive
at the other end of the socket.

The high-level interface uses packets (see `SF::Packet`),
which are easier to use and provide more safety regarding
the data that is exchanged. You can look at the `SF::Packet`
class to get more details about how they work.

The socket is automatically disconnected when it is destroyed,
but if you want to explicitly close the connection while
the socket instance is still alive, you can call disconnect.

Usage example:
```
# ----- The client -----

# Create a socket and connect it to 192.168.1.50 on port 55001
socket = SF::TcpSocket.new
socket.connect("192.168.1.50", 55001)

# Send a message to the connected host
message = "Hi, I am a client"
socket.send(message.to_slice)

# Receive an answer from the server
buffer = Slice(UInt8).new(1024)
status, received = socket.receive(buffer)
puts "The server said: #{buffer}"

# ----- The server -----

# Create a listener to wait for incoming connections on port 55001
listener = SF::TcpListener.new
listener.listen(55001)

# Wait for a connection
socket = SF::TcpSocket.new
listener.accept(socket)
puts "New client connected: #{socket.remote_address}"

# Receive a message from the client
buffer = Slice(UInt8).new(1024)
status, received = socket.receive(buffer)
puts "The client said: #{buffer}"

# Send an answer
message = "Welcome, client"
socket.send(message.to_slice)
```

## SF::TcpSocket#blocking?()

:nodoc:

## SF::TcpSocket#blocking=(blocking)

:nodoc:

## SF::TcpSocket#connect(remote_address,remote_port,timeout)

Connect the socket to a remote peer

In blocking mode, this function may take a while, especially
if the remote peer is not reachable. The last parameter allows
you to stop trying to connect after a given timeout.
If the socket is already connected, the connection is
forcibly disconnected before attempting to connect again.

* *remote_address* - Address of the remote peer
* *remote_port* - Port of the remote peer
* *timeout* - Optional maximum time to wait

*Returns:* Status code

*See also:* `disconnect`

## SF::TcpSocket#disconnect()

Disconnect the socket from its remote peer

This function gracefully closes the connection. If the
socket is not connected, this function has no effect.

*See also:* `connect`

## SF::TcpSocket#initialize()

Default constructor

## SF::TcpSocket#local_port()

Get the port to which the socket is bound locally

If the socket is not connected, this function returns 0.

*Returns:* Port to which the socket is bound

*See also:* `connect`, `remote_port`

## SF::TcpSocket#receive(data)

Receive raw data from the remote peer

In blocking mode, this function will wait until some
bytes are actually received.
This function will fail if the socket is not connected.

* *data* - The slice to fill with the received bytes

*Returns:*

* Status code
* The actual number of bytes received

*See also:* `send`

## SF::TcpSocket#receive(packet)

Receive a formatted packet of data from the remote peer

In blocking mode, this function will wait until the whole packet
has been received.
This function will fail if the socket is not connected.

* *packet* - Packet to fill with the received data

*Returns:* Status code

*See also:* `send`

## SF::TcpSocket#remote_address()

Get the address of the connected peer

It the socket is not connected, this function returns
`SF::IpAddress::None`.

*Returns:* Address of the remote peer

*See also:* `remote_port`

## SF::TcpSocket#remote_port()

Get the port of the connected peer to which
the socket is connected

If the socket is not connected, this function returns 0.

*Returns:* Remote port to which the socket is connected

*See also:* `remote_address`

## SF::TcpSocket#send(data)

Send raw data to the remote peer

To be able to handle partial sends over non-blocking
sockets, use the send(const void*, std::size_t, std::size_t&)
overload instead.
This function will fail if the socket is not connected.

* *data* - Pointer to the sequence of bytes to send
* *size* - Number of bytes to send

*Returns:* Status code

*See also:* `receive`

## SF::TcpSocket#send(data)

Send raw data to the remote peer

* Status code
* The number of bytes sent

*See also:* `receive`

## SF::TcpSocket#send(packet)

Send a formatted packet of data to the remote peer

In non-blocking mode, if this function returns `SF::Socket::Partial`,
you *must* retry sending the same unmodified packet before sending
anything else in order to guarantee the packet arrives at the remote
peer uncorrupted.
This function will fail if the socket is not connected.

* *packet* - Packet to send

*Returns:* Status code

*See also:* `receive`

# SF::UdpSocket

Specialized socket using the UDP protocol

A UDP socket is a connectionless socket. Instead of
connecting once to a remote host, like TCP sockets,
it can send to and receive from any host at any time.

It is a datagram protocol: bounded blocks of data (datagrams)
are transfered over the network rather than a continuous
stream of data (TCP). Therefore, one call to send will always
match one call to receive (if the datagram is not lost),
with the same data that was sent.

The UDP protocol is lightweight but unreliable. Unreliable
means that datagrams may be duplicated, be lost or
arrive reordered. However, if a datagram arrives, its
data is guaranteed to be valid.

UDP is generally used for real-time communication
(audio or video streaming, real-time games, etc.) where
speed is crucial and lost data doesn't matter much.

Sending and receiving data can use either the low-level
or the high-level functions. The low-level functions
process a raw sequence of bytes, whereas the high-level
interface uses packets (see `SF::Packet`), which are easier
to use and provide more safety regarding the data that is
exchanged. You can look at the `SF::Packet` class to get
more details about how they work.

It is important to note that UdpSocket is unable to send
datagrams bigger than MaxDatagramSize. In this case, it
returns an error and doesn't send anything. This applies
to both raw data and packets. Indeed, even packets are
unable to split and recompose data, due to the unreliability
of the protocol (dropped, mixed or duplicated datagrams may
lead to a big mess when trying to recompose a packet).

If the socket is bound to a port, it is automatically
unbound from it when the socket is destroyed. However,
you can unbind the socket explicitly with the Unbind
function if necessary, to stop receiving messages or
make the port available for other sockets.

Usage example:
```
# ----- The client -----

# Create a socket and bind it to the port 55001
socket = SF::UdpSocket.new
socket.bind(55001)

# Send a message to 192.168.1.50 on port 55002
message = "Hi, I am #{SF::IpAddress.local_address}"
socket.send(message.to_slice, "192.168.1.50", 55002)

# Receive an answer (most likely from 192.168.1.50, but could be anyone else)
buffer = Slice(UInt8).new(1024)
status, received, sender, port = socket.receive(buffer)
puts "#{sender} said: #{buffer}"

# ----- The server -----

# Create a socket and bind it to the port 55002
socket = SF::UdpSocket.new
socket.bind(55002)

# Receive a message from anyone
buffer = Slice(UInt8).new(1024)
status, received, sender, port = socket.receive(buffer)
puts "#{sender} said: #{buffer}"

# Send an answer
message = "Welcome #{sender}"
socket.send(message.to_slice, sender, port)
```

*See also:* `SF::Socket`, `SF::TcpSocket`, `SF::Packet`

## SF::UdpSocket::MaxDatagramSize

The maximum number of bytes that can be sent in a single UDP datagram

## SF::UdpSocket#bind(port,address)

Bind the socket to a specific port

Binding the socket to a port is necessary for being
able to receive data on that port.
You can use the special value Socket::AnyPort to tell the
system to automatically pick an available port, and then
call local_port to retrieve the chosen port.

Since the socket can only be bound to a single port at
any given moment, if it is already bound when this
function is called, it will be unbound from the previous
port before being bound to the new one.

* *port* - Port to bind the socket to
* *address* - Address of the interface to bind to

*Returns:* Status code

*See also:* `unbind`, `local_port`

## SF::UdpSocket#blocking?()

:nodoc:

## SF::UdpSocket#blocking=(blocking)

:nodoc:

## SF::UdpSocket#initialize()

Default constructor

## SF::UdpSocket#local_port()

Get the port to which the socket is bound locally

If the socket is not bound to a port, this function
returns 0.

*Returns:* Port to which the socket is bound

*See also:* `bind`

## SF::UdpSocket#receive(data)

Receive raw data from a remote peer

In blocking mode, this function will wait until some
bytes are actually received.
Be careful to use a buffer which is large enough for
the data that you intend to receive, if it is too small
then an error will be returned and *all* the data will
be lost.

* *data* - The slice to fill with the received bytes

*Returns:*

* Status code
* The actual number of bytes received
* Address of the peer that sent the data
* Port of the peer that sent the data

*See also:* `send`

## SF::UdpSocket#receive(packet)

Receive a formatted packet of data from a remote peer

In blocking mode, this function will wait until the whole packet
has been received.

* *packet* - Packet to fill with the received data

*Returns:*

* Status code
* Address of the peer that sent the data
* Port of the peer that sent the data

*See also:* `send`

## SF::UdpSocket#send(data,remote_address,remote_port)

Send raw data to a remote peer

Make sure that *data* size is not greater than
`UdpSocket::MaxDatagramSize`, otherwise this function will
fail and no data will be sent.

* *data* - Slice containing the sequence of bytes to send
* *remote_address* - Address of the receiver
* *remote_port* - Port of the receiver to send the data to

*Returns:* Status code

*See also:* `receive`

## SF::UdpSocket#send(packet,remote_address,remote_port)

Send a formatted packet of data to a remote peer

Make sure that the packet size is not greater than
UdpSocket::MaxDatagramSize, otherwise this function will
fail and no data will be sent.

* *packet* - Packet to send
* *remote_address* - Address of the receiver
* *remote_port* - Port of the receiver to send the data to

*Returns:* Status code

*See also:* `receive`

## SF::UdpSocket#unbind()

Unbind the socket from the local port to which it is bound

The port that the socket was previously bound to is immediately
made available to the operating system after this function is called.
This means that a subsequent call to `bind()` will be able to re-bind
the port if no other process has done so in the mean time.
If the socket is not bound to a port, this function has no effect.

*See also:* `bind`
