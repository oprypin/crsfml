# SF::BlendMode

Blending modes for drawing

`SF::BlendMode` is a struct that represents a blend mode. A blend
mode determines how the colors of an object you draw are
mixed with the colors that are already in the buffer.

The struct is composed of 6 components, each of which has its
own public member variable:

* Color Source Factor (`color_src_factor`)
* Color Destination Factor (`color_dst_factor`)
* Color Blend Equation (`color_equation`)
* Alpha Source Factor (`alpha_src_factor`)
* Alpha Destination Factor (`alpha_dst_factor`)
* Alpha Blend Equation (`alpha_equation`)

The source factor specifies how the pixel you are drawing contributes
to the final color. The destination factor specifies how the pixel
already drawn in the buffer contributes to the final color.

The color channels RGB (red, green, blue; simply referred to as
color) and A (alpha; the transparency) can be treated separately. This
separation can be useful for specific blend modes, but most often you
won't need it and will simply treat the color as a single unit.

The blend factors and equations correspond to their OpenGL equivalents.
In general, the color of the resulting pixel is calculated according
to the following formula (*src* is the color of the source pixel, *dst*
the color of the destination pixel, the other variables correspond to the
public members, with the equations being + or - operators):
```text
dst.rgb = color_src_factor * src.rgb (color_equation) color_dst_factor * dst.rgb
dst.a   = alpha_src_factor * src.a   (alpha_equation) alpha_dst_factor * dst.a
```

All factors and colors are represented as floating point numbers between
0 and 1. Where necessary, the result is clamped to fit in that range.

The most common blending modes are defined as constants in the SF module:
`SF::BlendAlpha`, `SF::BlendAdd`, `SF::BlendMultiply`, `SF::BlendNone`.

In SFML, a blend mode can be specified every time you draw a `SF::Drawable`
object to a render target. It is part of the `SF::RenderStates` compound
that is passed to the member function `SF::RenderTarget.draw()`.

# SF::CircleShape

Specialized shape representing a circle

This class inherits all the functions of `SF::Transformable`
(position, rotation, scale, bounds, ...) as well as the
functions of `SF::Shape` (outline, color, texture, ...).

Usage example:
```crystal
circle = SF::CircleShape.new
circle.radius = 150
circle.outline_color = SF::Color::Red
circle.outline_thickness = 5
circle.position = {10, 20}
# [...]
window.draw circle
```

Since the graphics card can't draw perfect circles, we have to
fake them with multiple triangles connected to each other. The
"points count" property of `SF::CircleShape` defines how many of these
triangles to use, and therefore defines the quality of the circle.

The number of points can also be used for another purpose; with
small numbers you can create any regular polygon shape:
equilateral triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, ...

# SF::Color

Utility struct for manipulating RGBA colors

`SF::Color` is a simple color struct composed of 4 components:

* Red
* Green
* Blue
* Alpha (opacity)

Each component is a public member, an unsigned integer in
the range `0..255`. Thus, colors can be constructed and
manipulated very easily:

```crystal
color = SF::Color.new(255, 0, 0) # red
color.r = 0                      # make it black
color.b = 128                    # make it dark blue
```

The fourth component of colors, named "alpha", represents
the opacity of the color. A color with an alpha value of
255 will be fully opaque, while an alpha value of 0 will
make a color fully transparent, whatever the value of the
other components is.

The most common colors are already defined as static variables:
```crystal
black = SF::Color::Black
white = SF::Color::White
red = SF::Color::Red
green = SF::Color::Green
blue = SF::Color::Blue
yellow = SF::Color::Yellow
magenta = SF::Color::Magenta
cyan = SF::Color::Cyan
transparent = SF::Color::Transparent
```

Colors can also be added and modulated (multiplied) using the
overloaded operators + and *.

## SF::Color#a()

Alpha (opacity) component

## SF::Color#b()

Blue component

## SF::Color#g()

Green component

## SF::Color#initialize()

Default constructor

Constructs an opaque black color. It is equivalent to
`SF::Color.new(0, 0, 0, 255)`.

## SF::Color#initialize(color)

* *color* - Number containing the RGBA components (in that order)

## SF::Color#initialize(copy)

:nodoc:

## SF::Color#initialize(red,green,blue,alpha)

Construct the color from its 4 RGBA components

* *red* - Red component (in the range `0..255`)
* *green* - Green component (in the range `0..255`)
* *blue* - Blue component (in the range `0..255`)
* *alpha* - Alpha (opacity) component (in the range `0..255`)

## SF::Color#r()

*Returns:* Result of *left* - *right*

## SF::Color#*(right)

Overload of the binary * operator

This operator returns the component-wise multiplication
(also called "modulation") of two colors.
Components are then divided by 255 so that the result is
still in the range `0 .. 255`.

* *left* - Left operand
* *right* - Right operand

*Returns:* Result of *left* * *right*

## SF::Color#to_integer()

# SF::ConvexShape

Specialized shape representing a convex polygon

This class inherits all the functions of `SF::Transformable`
(position, rotation, scale, bounds, ...) as well as the
functions of `SF::Shape` (outline, color, texture, ...).

It is important to keep in mind that a convex shape must
always be... convex, otherwise it may not be drawn correctly.
Moreover, the points must be defined in order; using a random
order would result in an incorrect shape.

Usage example:
```crystal
polygon = SF::ConvexShape.new
polygon.point_count = 3
polygon[0] = SF.vector2f(0, 0)
polygon[1] = SF.vector2f(0, 10)
polygon[2] = SF.vector2f(25, 5)
polygon.outline_color = SF::Color::Red
polygon.outline_thickness = 5
polygon.position = {10, 20}
# [...]
window.draw polygon

# SF::Drawable

Abstract module for objects that can be drawn
to a render target

`SF::Drawable` is a very simple module that allows objects
of derived classes to be drawn to a `SF::RenderTarget`.

All you have to do in your derived class is to implement the
`draw` function.

Note that including `SF::Drawable` is not mandatory,
but it allows this nice syntax `window.draw(object)` rather
than `object.draw(window)`, which is more consistent with other
SFML classes.

Example:
```crystal
class MyDrawable
  include SF::Drawable

  def draw(target : SF::RenderTarget, states : SF::RenderStates)
    # You can draw other high-level objects
    target.draw(@sprite, states)

    # ... or use the low-level API
    states.texture = @texture
    target.draw(@vertices, states)

    # ... or draw with OpenGL directly
    glBegin(GL_QUADS)
    # [...]
    glEnd()
  end

  @sprite : SF::Sprite
  @texture : SF::Texture
  @vertices : SF::VertexArray
end
```

*See also:* `SF::RenderTarget`

# SF::Font

Class for loading and manipulating character fonts

Fonts can be loaded from a file, from memory or from a custom
stream, and supports the most common types of fonts. See
the `load_from_file` function for the complete list of supported formats.

Once it is loaded, a `SF::Font` instance provides three
types of information about the font:

* Global metrics, such as the line spacing
* Per-glyph metrics, such as bounding box or kerning
* Pixel representation of glyphs

Fonts alone are not very useful: they hold the font data
but cannot make anything useful of it. To do so you need to
use the `SF::Text` class, which is able to properly output text
with several options such as character size, style, color,
position, rotation, etc.
This separation allows more flexibility and better performances:
indeed a `SF::Font` is a heavy resource, and any operation on it
is slow (often too slow for real-time applications). On the other
side, a `SF::Text` is a lightweight object which can combine the
glyphs data and metrics of a `SF::Font` to display any text on a
render target.
Note that it is also possible to bind several `SF::Text` instances
to the same `SF::Font`.

It is important to note that the `SF::Text` instance doesn't
copy the font that it uses, it only keeps a reference to it.
Thus, a `SF::Font` must not be destructed while it is
used by a `SF::Text` (i.e. never write a function that
uses a local `SF::Font` instance for creating a text).

Usage example:
```crystal
# Load a new font from file
font = SF::Font.from_file("arial.ttf")

# Create a text which uses our font
text1 = SF::Text.new("text", font, 30)

# Create another text using the same font, but with different parameters
text2 = SF::Text.new
text2.font = font
text2.character_size = 50
text2.style = SF::Text::Italic
```

Apart from loading font files, and passing them to instances
of `SF::Text`, you should normally not have to deal directly
with this class. However, it may be useful to access the
font metrics or rasterized glyphs for advanced usage.

Note that if the font is a bitmap font, it is not scalable,
thus not all requested sizes will be available to use. This
needs to be taken into consideration when using `SF::Text`.
If you need to display text of a certain size, make sure the
corresponding bitmap font that supports that size is used.

*See also:* `SF::Text`

## SF::Font::Info

Holds various information about a font

### SF::Font::Info#family()

The font family

### SF::Font::Info#initialize(copy)

:nodoc:

## SF::Font#finalize()

Destructor

Cleans up all the internal resources used by the font

## SF::Font#get_glyph(code_point,character_size,bold,outline_thickness)

Retrieve a glyph of the font

If the font is a bitmap font, not all character sizes
might be available. If the glyph is not available at the
requested size, an empty glyph is returned.

Be aware that using a negative value for the outline
thickness will cause distorted rendering.

* *code_point* - Unicode code point of the character to get
* *character_size* - Reference character size
* *bold* - Retrieve the bold version or the regular one?
* *outline_thickness* - Thickness of outline (when != 0 the glyph will not be filled)

*Returns:* The glyph corresponding to *code_point* and *character_size*

## SF::Font#get_kerning(first,second,character_size)

Get the kerning offset of two glyphs

The kerning is an extra offset (negative) to apply between two
glyphs when rendering them, to make the pair look more "natural".
For example, the pair "AV" have a special kerning to make them
closer than other characters. Most of the glyphs pairs have a
kerning offset of zero, though.

* *first* - Unicode code point of the first character
* *second* - Unicode code point of the second character
* *character_size* - Reference character size

*Returns:* Kerning value for *first* and *second*, in pixels

## SF::Font#get_line_spacing(character_size)

Get the line spacing

Line spacing is the vertical offset to apply between two
consecutive lines of text.

* *character_size* - Reference character size

*Returns:* Line spacing, in pixels

## SF::Font#get_texture(character_size)

Retrieve the texture containing the loaded glyphs of a certain size

The contents of the returned texture changes as more glyphs
are requested, thus it is not very relevant. It is mainly
used internally by `SF::Text`.

* *character_size* - Reference character size

*Returns:* Texture containing the glyphs of the requested size

## SF::Font#get_underline_position(character_size)

Get the position of the underline

Underline position is the vertical offset to apply between the
baseline and the underline.

* *character_size* - Reference character size

*Returns:* Underline position, in pixels

*See also:* `underline_thickness`

## SF::Font#get_underline_thickness(character_size)

Get the thickness of the underline

Underline thickness is the vertical size of the underline.

* *character_size* - Reference character size

*Returns:* Underline thickness, in pixels

*See also:* `underline_position`

# SF::Image

Class for loading, manipulating and saving images

`SF::Image` is an abstraction to manipulate images
as bidimensional arrays of pixels. The class provides
functions to load, read, write and save pixels, as well
as many other useful functions.

`SF::Image` can handle a unique internal representation of
pixels, which is RGBA 32 bits. This means that a pixel
must be composed of 8 bits red, green, blue and alpha
channels -- just like a `SF::Color`.
All the functions that return an array of pixels follow
this rule, and all parameters that you pass to `SF::Image`
functions (such as load_from_memory) must use this
representation as well.

A `SF::Image` can be copied, but it is a heavy resource and
if possible you should always use [const] references to
pass or return them to avoid useless copies.

Usage example:
```crystal
# Load an image file from a file
background = SF::Image.from_file("background.jpg")

# Create a 20x20 image filled with black color
image = SF::Image.new(20, 20, SF::Color::Black)

# Copy image1 on image2 at position (10, 10)
image.copy(background, 10, 10)

# Make the top-left pixel transparent

## SF::Image#copy(source,dest_x,dest_y,source_rect,apply_alpha)

Copy pixels from another image onto this one

This function does a slow pixel copy and should not be
used intensively. It can be used to prepare a complex
static image from several others, but if you need this
kind of feature in real-time you'd better use `SF::RenderTexture`.

If *source_rect* is empty, the whole image is copied.
If *apply_alpha* is set to true, the transparency of
source pixels is applied. If it is false, the pixels are
copied unchanged with their alpha value.

* *source* - Source image to copy
* *dest_x* - X coordinate of the destination position
* *dest_y* - Y coordinate of the destination position
* *source_rect* - Sub-rectangle of the source image to copy
* *apply_alpha* - Should the copy take into account the source transparency?

## SF::Image#create(width,height,color)

Create the image and fill it with a unique color

* *width* - Width of the image
* *height* - Height of the image
* *color* - Fill color

## SF::Image#create(width,height,pixels)

Create the image from an array of pixels

The *pixel* array is assumed to contain 32-bits RGBA pixels,
and have the given *width* and *height*. If not, this is
an undefined behavior.
If *pixels* is null, an empty image is created.

* *width* - Width of the image
* *height* - Height of the image
* *pixels* - Array of pixels to copy to the image

## SF::Image#create_mask_from_color(color,alpha)

Create a transparency mask from a specified color-key

This function sets the alpha value of every pixel matching
the given color to *alpha* (0 by default), so that they
become transparent.

* *color* - Color to make transparent
* *alpha* - Alpha value to assign to transparent pixels

## SF::Image#finalize()

Destructor

## SF::Image#flip_horizontally()

Flip the image horizontally (left &lt;-&gt; right)

## SF::Image#flip_vertically()

Flip the image vertically (top &lt;-&gt; bottom)

## SF::Image#get_pixel(x,y)

Get the color of a pixel

This function doesn't check the validity of the pixel
coordinates, using out-of-range values will result in
an undefined behavior.

* *x* - X coordinate of pixel to get
* *y* - Y coordinate of pixel to get

*Returns:* Color of the pixel at coordinates (x, y)

*See also:* `pixel=`

modify the image, so you should never store it for too long.
If the image is empty, a null pointer is returned.

*Returns:* Read-only pointer to the array of pixels

## SF::Image#save_to_file(filename)

# SF::RenderStates

Define the states used for drawing to a `RenderTarget`

There are four global states that can be applied to
the drawn objects:

* the blend mode: how pixels of the object are blended with the background
* the transform: how the object is positioned/rotated/scaled
* the texture: what image is mapped to the object
* the shader: what custom effect is applied to the object

High-level objects such as sprites or text force some of
these states when they are drawn. For example, a sprite
will set its own texture, so that you don't have to care
about it when drawing the sprite.

The transform is a special case: sprites, texts and shapes
(and it's a good idea to do it with your own drawable classes
too) combine their transform with the one that is passed in the
RenderStates structure. So that you can use a "global" transform
on top of each object's transform.

Most objects, especially high-level drawables, can be drawn
directly without defining render states explicitly -- the
default set of states is OK in most cases.
```crystal
window.draw(sprite)
```

If you want to use a single specific render state, for example a
shader, you can pass it to the constructor of `SF::RenderStates`.
```crystal
window.draw(sprite, SF::RenderStates.new(shader))
```

When you're inside the `draw` function of a drawable
object (one that includes `SF::Drawable`), you can
either pass the render states unmodified, or change
some of them.
For example, a transformable object will combine the
current transform with its own transform. A sprite will
set its texture. Etc.

*See also:* `SF::RenderTarget`, `SF::Drawable`

## SF::RenderStates#blend_mode()

Blending mode

## SF::RenderStates#initialize()

Default constructor

Constructing a default set of render states is equivalent
to using `SF::RenderStates::Default`.
The default set defines:

* the `BlendAlpha` blend mode
* the identity transform
* a null texture
* a null shader

## SF::RenderStates#initialize(blend_mode)

Construct a default set of render states with a custom blend mode

* *blend_mode* - Blend mode to use

# SF::RenderTarget

Base module for all render targets (window, texture, ...)

`SF::RenderTarget` defines the common behavior of all the
2D render targets usable in the graphics module. It makes
it possible to draw 2D entities like sprites, shapes, text
without using any OpenGL command directly.

A `SF::RenderTarget` is also able to use views (`SF::View`),
which are a kind of 2D cameras. With views you can globally
scroll, rotate or zoom everything that is drawn,
without having to transform every single entity. See the
documentation of `SF::View` for more details and sample pieces of
code about this module.

On top of that, render targets are still able to render direct
OpenGL stuff. It is even possible to mix together OpenGL calls
and regular SFML drawing commands. When doing so, make sure that
OpenGL states are not messed up by calling the
`push_gl_states`/`pop_gl_states` functions.

*See also:* `SF::RenderWindow`, `SF::RenderTexture`, `SF::View`

## SF::RenderTarget#active=(active)

Activate or deactivate the render target for rendering

This function makes the render target's context current for
future OpenGL rendering operations (so you shouldn't care
about it if you're not doing direct OpenGL stuff).
A render target's context is active only on the current thread,
if you want to make it active on another thread you have
to deactivate it on the previous thread first if it was active.
Only one context can be current in a thread, so if you
want to draw OpenGL geometry to another render target
don't forget to activate it again. Activating a render
target will automatically deactivate the previously active
context (if any).

* *active* - True to activate, false to deactivate

*Returns:* True if operation was successful, false otherwise

## SF::RenderTarget#clear(color)

Clear the entire target with a single color

This function is usually called once every frame,
to clear the previous contents of the target.

* *color* - Fill color to use to clear the render target

## SF::RenderTarget#default_view()

Get the default view of the render target

The default view has the initial size of the render target,
and never changes after the target has been created.

*Returns:* The default view of the render target

*See also:* `view=`, `view`

## SF::RenderTarget#draw(vertex_buffer,first_vertex,vertex_count,states)

Draw primitives defined by a vertex buffer

* *vertex_buffer* - Vertex buffer
* *first_vertex* - Index of the first vertex to render
* *vertex_count* - Number of vertices to render
* *states* - Render states to use for drawing

## SF::RenderTarget#draw(vertex_buffer,states)

Draw primitives defined by a vertex buffer

* *vertex_buffer* - Vertex buffer
* *states* - Render states to use for drawing

## SF::RenderTarget#draw(vertices,type,states)

Draw primitives defined by an array of vertices

* *vertices* - Pointer to the vertices
* *vertex_count* - Number of vertices in the array
* *type* - Type of primitives to draw
* *states* - Render states to use for drawing

## SF::RenderTarget#get_viewport(view)

Get the viewport of a view, applied to this render target

The viewport is defined in the view as a ratio, this function
simply applies this ratio to the current dimensions of the
render target to calculate the pixels rectangle that the viewport
actually covers in the target.

* *view* - The view for which we want to compute the viewport

*Returns:* Viewport rectangle, expressed in pixels

## SF::RenderTarget#map_coords_to_pixel(point)

Convert a point from world coordinates to target
coordinates, using the current view

This function is an overload of the map_coords_to_pixel
function that implicitly uses the current view.
It is equivalent to:
```crystal
target.map_coords_to_pixel(point, target.view)
```

* *point* - Point to convert

*Returns:* The converted point, in target coordinates (pixels)

*See also:* `map_pixel_to_coords`

## SF::RenderTarget#map_coords_to_pixel(point,view)

Convert a point from world coordinates to target coordinates

This function finds the pixel of the render target that matches
the given 2D point. In other words, it goes through the same process
as the graphics card, to compute the final position of a rendered point.

Initially, both coordinate systems (world units and target pixels)
match perfectly. But if you define a custom view or resize your
render target, this assertion is not true anymore, i.e. a point
located at (150, 75) in your 2D world may map to the pixel
(10, 50) of your render target -- if the view is translated by (140, 25).

This version uses a custom view for calculations, see the other
overload of the function if you want to use the current view of the
render target.

* *point* - Point to convert
* *view* - The view to use for converting the point

*Returns:* The converted point, in target coordinates (pixels)

*See also:* `map_pixel_to_coords`

## SF::RenderTarget#map_pixel_to_coords(point)

Convert a point from target coordinates to world
coordinates, using the current view

This function is an overload of the map_pixel_to_coords
function that implicitly uses the current view.
It is equivalent to:
```crystal
target.map_pixel_to_coords(point, target.view)
```

* *point* - Pixel to convert

*Returns:* The converted point, in "world" coordinates

*See also:* `map_coords_to_pixel`

## SF::RenderTarget#map_pixel_to_coords(point,view)

Convert a point from target coordinates to world coordinates

This function finds the 2D position that matches the
given pixel of the render target. In other words, it does
the inverse of what the graphics card does, to find the
initial position of a rendered pixel.

Initially, both coordinate systems (world units and target pixels)
match perfectly. But if you define a custom view or resize your
render target, this assertion is not true anymore, i.e. a point
located at (10, 50) in your render target may map to the point
(150, 75) in your 2D world -- if the view is translated by (140, 25).

For render-windows, this function is typically used to find
which point (or object) is located below the mouse cursor.

This version uses a custom view for calculations, see the other
overload of the function if you want to use the current view of the
render target.

* *point* - Pixel to convert
* *view* - The view to use for converting the point

*Returns:* The converted point, in "world" units

*See also:* `map_coords_to_pixel`

## SF::RenderTarget#pop_gl_states()

Restore the previously saved OpenGL render states and matrices

See the description of `push_gl_states` to get a detailed
description of these functions.

*See also:* `push_gl_states`

## SF::RenderTarget#push_gl_states()

Save the current OpenGL render states and matrices

This function can be used when you mix SFML drawing
and direct OpenGL rendering. Combined with pop_gl_states,
it ensures that:

* SFML's internal states are not messed up by your OpenGL code
* your OpenGL states are not modified by a call to a SFML function

More specifically, it must be used around code that
calls Draw functions. Example:
```crystal
# OpenGL code here...
window.push_gl_states
window.draw(...)
window.draw(...)
window.pop_gl_states
# OpenGL code here...
```

Note that this function is quite expensive: it saves all the
possible OpenGL states and matrices, even the ones you
don't care about. Therefore it should be used wisely.
It is provided for convenience, but the best results will
be achieved if you handle OpenGL states yourself (because
you know which states have really changed, and need to be
saved and restored). Take a look at the reset_gl_states
function if you do so.

*See also:* `pop_gl_states`

## SF::RenderTarget#reset_gl_states()

Reset the internal OpenGL states so that the target is ready for drawing

This function can be used when you mix SFML drawing
and direct OpenGL rendering, if you choose not to use
`push_gl_states`/`pop_gl_states`. It makes sure that all OpenGL
states needed by SFML are set, so that subsequent `draw()`
calls will work as expected.

Example:
```crystal
# OpenGL code here...
glPushAttrib(...)
window.reset_gl_states
window.draw(...)
window.draw(...)
glPopAttrib(...)
# OpenGL code here...
```

## SF::RenderTarget#size()

Return the size of the rendering region of the target

*Returns:* Size in pixels

## SF::RenderTarget#view()

Get the view currently in use in the render target

*Returns:* The view object that is currently used

*See also:* `view=`, `default_view`

## SF::RenderTarget#view=(view)

Change the current active view

The view is like a 2D camera, it controls which part of
the 2D scene is visible, and how it is viewed in the
render target.
The new view will affect everything that is drawn, until
another view is set.
The render target keeps its own copy of the view object,
so it is not necessary to keep the original one alive
after calling this function.
To restore the original view of the target, you can pass
the result of `default_view()` to this function.

* *view* - New view to use

*See also:* `view`, `default_view`

# SF::RenderTexture

Target for off-screen 2D rendering into a texture

`SF::RenderTexture` is the little brother of `SF::RenderWindow`.
It implements the same 2D drawing and OpenGL-related functions
(see their base class `SF::RenderTarget` for more details),
the difference is that the result is stored in an off-screen
texture rather than being show in a window.

Rendering to a texture can be useful in a variety of situations:

* precomputing a complex static texture (like a level's background from multiple tiles)
* applying post-effects to the whole scene with shaders
* creating a sprite from a 3D object rendered with OpenGL
* etc.

Usage example:

```crystal
# Create a new render-window
window = SF::RenderWindow.new(SF::VideoMode.new(800, 600), "SFML window")

# Create a new render-texture
texture = SF::RenderTexture.new(500, 500)

# The main loop
while window.open?
  # Event processing
  # ...

  # Clear the whole texture with red color
  texture.clear(SF::Color::Red)

  # Draw stuff to the texture
  texture.draw(sprite) # sprite is a SF::Sprite
  texture.draw(shape)  # shape is a SF::Shape
  texture.draw(text)   # text is a SF::Text

  # We're done drawing to the texture
  texture.display

  # Now we start rendering to the window, clear it first
  window.clear

  # Draw the texture
  sprite = SF::Sprite.new(texture.texture)
  window.draw(sprite)

  # End the current frame and display its contents on screen
  window.display
end
```

Like `SF::RenderWindow`, `SF::RenderTexture` is still able to render direct
OpenGL stuff. It is even possible to mix together OpenGL calls
and regular SFML drawing commands. If you need a depth buffer for
3D rendering, don't forget to request it when calling `RenderTexture.create`.

*See also:* `SF::RenderTarget`, `SF::RenderWindow`, `SF::View`, `SF::Texture`

## SF::RenderTexture#active=(active)

Activate or deactivate the render-texture for rendering

This function makes the render-texture's context current for
future OpenGL rendering operations (so you shouldn't care
about it if you're not doing direct OpenGL stuff).
Only one context can be current in a thread, so if you
want to draw OpenGL geometry to another render target
(like a RenderWindow) don't forget to activate it again.

* *active* - True to activate, false to deactivate

*Returns:* True if operation was successful, false otherwise

## SF::RenderTexture#clear(color)

:nodoc:

## SF::RenderTexture#create(width,height,depth_buffer)

Create the render-texture

Before calling this function, the render-texture is in
an invalid state, thus it is mandatory to call it before
doing anything with the render-texture.
The last parameter, *depth_buffer*, is useful if you want
to use the render-texture for 3D OpenGL rendering that requires
a depth buffer. Otherwise it is unnecessary, and you should
leave this parameter to false (which is its default value).

* *width* - Width of the render-texture
* *height* - Height of the render-texture
* *depth_buffer* - Do you want this render-texture to have a depth buffer?

*Returns:* True if creation has been successful

DEPRECATED: Use `create(width, height, settings)` instead.

## SF::RenderTexture#create(width,height,settings)

Create the render-texture

Before calling this function, the render-texture is in
an invalid state, thus it is mandatory to call it before
doing anything with the render-texture.
The last parameter, *settings*, is useful if you want to enable
multi-sampling or use the render-texture for OpenGL rendering that
requires a depth or stencil buffer. Otherwise it is unnecessary, and
you should leave this parameter at its default value.

* *width* - Width of the render-texture
* *height* - Height of the render-texture
* *settings* - Additional settings for the underlying OpenGL texture and context

*Returns:* True if creation has been successful

## SF::RenderTexture#default_view()

:nodoc:

## SF::RenderTexture#display()

Update the contents of the target texture

This function updates the target texture with what
has been drawn so far. Like for windows, calling this
function is mandatory at the end of rendering. Not calling
it may leave the texture in an undefined state.

## SF::RenderTexture#finalize()

Destructor

## SF::RenderTexture#generate_mipmap()

Generate a mipmap using the current texture data

This function is similar to Texture.generate_mipmap and operates
on the texture used as the target for drawing.
Be aware that any draw operation may modify the base level image data.
For this reason, calling this function only makes sense after all
drawing is completed and display has been called. Not calling display
after subsequent drawing will lead to undefined behavior if a mipmap
had been previously generated.

*Returns:* True if mipmap generation was successful, false if unsuccessful

## SF::RenderTexture#get_viewport(view)

*See also:* `repeated?`

## SF::RenderTexture#reset_gl_states()

*Returns:* True if texture smoothing is enabled

*See also:* `smooth=`

Enable or disable texture smoothing

This function is similar to `Texture.smooth=`.
This parameter is disabled by default.

* *smooth* - True to enable smoothing, false to disable it

*See also:* `smooth?`

## SF::RenderTexture#texture()

Get a read-only reference to the target texture

After drawing to the render-texture and calling Display,
you can retrieve the updated texture using this function,
and draw it using a sprite (for example).
The internal `SF::Texture` of a render-texture is always the
same instance, so that it is possible to call this function
once and keep a reference to the texture even after it is
modified.

*Returns:* Const reference to the texture

Window that can serve as a target for 2D drawing

`SF::RenderWindow` is the main class of the Graphics module.
It defines an OS window that can be painted using the other
classes of the graphics module.

`SF::RenderWindow` is derived from `SF::Window`, thus it inherits
all its features: events, window management, OpenGL rendering,
etc. See the documentation of `SF::Window` for a more complete
description of all these features, as well as code examples.

On top of that, `SF::RenderWindow` adds more features related to
2D drawing with the graphics module (see its base module
`SF::RenderTarget` for more details).
Here is a typical rendering and event loop with a `SF::RenderWindow`:

```crystal
# Declare and create a new render-window
window = SF::RenderWindow.new(SF::VideoMode.new(800, 600), "SFML window")

# Limit the framerate to 60 frames per second (this step is optional)
window.framerate_limit = 60

# The main loop - ends as soon as the window is closed
while window.open?
  # Event processing
  while (event = window.poll_event)
    # Request for closing the window
    if event.is_a? SF::Event::Closed
      window.close
    end
  end

  # Clear the whole window before rendering a new frame
  window.clear

  # Draw some graphical entities
  window.draw sprite
  window.draw circle
  window.draw text

  # End the current frame and display its contents on screen
  window.display
end
```

Like `SF::Window`, `SF::RenderWindow` is still able to render direct
OpenGL stuff. It is even possible to mix together OpenGL calls
and regular SFML drawing commands.

```crystal
# Create the render window
window = SF::RenderWindow.new(SF::VideoMode.new(800, 600), "SFML OpenGL")

# Create a sprite and a text to display
sprite = SF::Sprite.new
text = SF::Text.new
# [...]

# Perform OpenGL initializations
glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION)
# [...]

# Start the rendering loop
while window.open?
  # Process events
  # [...]

  # Draw a background sprite
  window.push_gl_states
  window.draw sprite
  window.pop_gl_states

  # Draw a 3D object using OpenGL
  glBegin(GL_QUADS)
  glVertex3f(...)
  # [...]
  glEnd

  # Draw text on top of the 3D object
  window.push_gl_states
  window.draw text
  window.pop_gl_states

  # Finally, display the rendered frame on screen
  window.display
end
```

*See also:* `SF::Window`, `SF::RenderTarget`, `SF::RenderTexture`, `SF::View`

## SF::RenderWindow#active=(active)

Activate or deactivate the window as the current target
for OpenGL rendering

A window is active only on the current thread, if you want to
make it active on another thread you have to deactivate it
on the previous thread first if it was active.
Only one window can be active on a thread at a time, thus
the window previously active (if any) automatically gets deactivated.
This is not to be confused with `request_focus()`.

* *active* - True to activate, false to deactivate

*Returns:* True if operation was successful, false otherwise

## SF::RenderWindow#capture()

Copy the current contents of the window to an image

DEPRECATED:
Use a `SF::Texture` and its `SF::Texture#update(window)`
method and copy its contents into an `SF::Image` instead.

```crystal
texture = SF::Texture.new(window.size.x, window.size.y)
texture.update(window)
screenshot = texture.copy_to_image
```

This is a slow operation, whose main purpose is to make
screenshots of the application. If you want to update an
image with the contents of the window and then use it for
drawing, you should rather use a `SF::Texture` and its
`update(window)` method.
You can also draw things directly to a texture with the
`SF::RenderTexture` class.

*Returns:* Image containing the captured contents

# SF::Shader

Shader class (vertex, geometry and fragment)

Shaders are programs written using a specific language,
executed directly by the graphics card and allowing
to apply real-time operations to the rendered entities.

There are three kinds of shaders:

* Vertex shaders, that process vertices
* Geometry shaders, that process primitives
* Fragment (pixel) shaders, that process pixels

A `SF::Shader` can be composed of either a vertex shader
alone, a geometry shader alone, a fragment shader alone,
or any combination of them. (see the variants of the
load functions).

Shaders are written in GLSL, which is a C-like
language dedicated to OpenGL shaders. You'll probably
need to learn its basics before writing your own shaders
for SFML.

Like any C/C++ program, a GLSL shader has its own variables
called *uniforms* that you can set from your C++ application.
`SF::Shader` handles different types of uniforms:

* scalars: `float`, `int`, `bool`
* vectors (2, 3 or 4 components)
* matrices (3x3 or 4x4)
* samplers (textures)

Some SFML-specific types can be converted:

* `SF::Color` as a 4D vector (`vec4`)
* `SF::Transform` as matrices (`mat3` or `mat4`)

Every uniform variable in a shader can be set through one of the
`set_parameter` overloads, or through a shorthand. For example, if you
have a shader with the following uniforms:
```glsl
uniform float offset;
uniform vec3 point;
uniform vec4 color;
uniform mat4 matrix;
uniform sampler2D overlay;
uniform sampler2D current;
```

You can set their values from Crystal code as follows:
```crystal
shader.offset 2.0
shader.point 0.5, 0.8, 0.3
shader.color color      # color is a SF::Color
shader.matrix transform # transform is a SF::Transform
shader.overlay texture  # texture is a SF::Texture
shader.current SF::Shader::CurrentTexture
```

The special Shader::CurrentTexture argument maps the
given `sampler2d` uniform to the current texture of the
object being drawn (which cannot be known in advance).

To apply a shader to a drawable, you must pass it as an
additional parameter to the `Window.draw` function:
```crystal
states = SF::RenderStates.new(shader)
window.draw(sprite, states)
```

In the code above we pass a pointer to the shader, because it may
be null (which means "no shader").

Shaders can be used on any drawable, but some combinations are
not interesting. For example, using a vertex shader on a `SF::Sprite`
is limited because there are only 4 vertices, the sprite would
have to be subdivided in order to apply wave effects.
Another bad example is a fragment shader with `SF::Text`: the texture
of the text is not the actual text that you see on screen, it is
a big texture containing all the characters of the font in an
arbitrary order; thus, texture lookups on pixels other than the
current one may not give you the expected result.

Shaders can also be used to apply global post-effects to the
current contents of the target. This can be done in two different ways:

* draw everything to a `SF::RenderTexture`, then draw it to
the main target using the shader
* draw everything directly to the main target, then use
`SF::Texture.update(window)` to copy its contents to a texture
and draw it to the main target using the shader

The first technique is more optimized because it doesn't involve
retrieving the target's pixels to system memory, but the
second one doesn't impact the rendering process and can be
easily inserted anywhere without impacting all the code.

Like `SF::Texture` that can be used as a raw OpenGL texture,
`SF::Shader` can also be used directly as a raw shader for
custom OpenGL geometry.
```crystal
SF::Shader.bind shader
# ... render OpenGL geometry ...
SF::Shader.bind nil
```

## SF::Shader.available?()

Tell whether or not the system supports shaders

This function should always be called before using
the shader features. If it returns false, then
any attempt to use `SF::Shader` will fail.

*Returns:* True if shaders are supported, false otherwise

## SF::Shader.bind(shader)

Bind a shader for rendering

This function is not part of the graphics API, it mustn't be
used when drawing SFML entities. It must be used only if you
mix `SF::Shader` with OpenGL code.

```crystal
s1 = SF::Shader.new
s2 = SF::Shader.new
# [...]
SF::Shader.bind s1
# draw OpenGL stuff that use s1...
SF::Shader.bind s2
# draw OpenGL stuff that use s2...
SF::Shader.bind nil
# draw OpenGL stuff that use no shader...
```

## SF::Shader.geometry_available?()

Tell whether or not the system supports geometry shaders

This function should always be called before using

any attempt to use `SF::Shader` geometry shader features will fail.

This function can only return true if `available?()` would also
return true, since shaders in general have to be supported in
order for geometry shaders to be supported as well.

Note: The first call to this function, whether by your
code or SFML will result in a context switch.

# SF::Shape

Base class for textured shapes with outline

`SF::Shape` is a drawable class that allows to define and
display a custom convex shape on a render target.
It's only an abstract base, it needs to be specialized for
concrete types of shapes (circle, rectangle, convex polygon,
star, ...).

In addition to the attributes provided by the specialized
shape classes, a shape always has the following attributes:

* a texture
* a texture rectangle
* a fill color
* an outline color
* an outline thickness

Each feature is optional, and can be disabled easily:

* the texture can be null
* the fill/outline colors can be `SF::Color::Transparent`
* the outline thickness can be zero

You can write your own derived shape class, there are only
two virtual functions to override:

* `point_count` must return the number of points of the shape
* `get_point` must return the points of the shape

*See also:* `SF::RectangleShape`, `SF::CircleShape`, `SF::ConvexShape`, `SF::Transformable`

## SF::Shape#fill_color()

Get the fill color of the shape

*Returns:* Fill color of the shape

*See also:* `fill_color=`

## SF::Shape#fill_color=(color)

Set the fill color of the shape

This color is modulated (multiplied) with the shape's
texture if any. It can be used to colorize the shape,
or change its global opacity.
You can use `SF::Color::Transparent` to make the inside of
the shape transparent, and have the outline alone.
By default, the shape's fill color is opaque white.

* *color* - New color of the shape

*See also:* `fill_color`, `outline_color=`

## SF::Shape#finalize()

Virtual destructor

## SF::Shape#get_point(index)

Get a point of the shape

The returned point is in local coordinates, that is,
the shape's transforms (position, rotation, scale) are
not taken into account.
The result is undefined if *index* is out of the valid range.

* *index* - Index of the point to get, in range `0 ... point_count`

*Returns:* index-th point of the shape

*See also:* `point_count`

## SF::Shape#global_bounds()

Get the global (non-minimal) bounding rectangle of the entity

The returned rectangle is in global coordinates, which means
that it takes into account the transformations (translation,
rotation, scale, ...) that are applied to the entity.
In other words, this function returns the bounds of the
shape in the global 2D world's coordinate system.

This function does not necessarily return the *minimal*
bounding rectangle. It merely ensures that the returned
rectangle covers all the vertices (but possibly more).
This allows for a fast approximation of the bounds as a
first check; you may want to use more precise checks
on top of that.

*Returns:* Global bounding rectangle of the entity

## SF::Shape#initialize()

Default constructor

## SF::Shape#inverse_transform()

:nodoc:

## SF::Shape#local_bounds()

Get the local bounding rectangle of the entity

The returned rectangle is in local coordinates, which means
that it ignores the transformations (translation, rotation,
scale, ...) that are applied to the entity.
In other words, this function returns the bounds of the
entity in the entity's coordinate system.

*Returns:* Local bounding rectangle of the entity

## SF::Shape#outline_color=(color)

Set the outline color of the shape

By default, the shape's outline color is opaque white.

* *color* - New outline color of the shape

*See also:* `outline_color`, `fill_color=`

## SF::Shape#outline_thickness()

Get the outline thickness of the shape

*Returns:* Outline thickness of the shape

*See also:* `outline_thickness=`

## SF::Shape#outline_thickness=(thickness)

Set the thickness of the shape's outline

Note that negative values are allowed (so that the outline
expands towards the center of the shape), and using zero
disables the outline.
By default, the outline thickness is 0.

* *thickness* - New outline thickness

*See also:* `outline_thickness`

## SF::Shape#set_texture(texture,reset_rect)

Change the source texture of the shape

The *texture* argument refers to a texture that must
exist as long as the shape uses it. Indeed, the shape
doesn't store its own copy of the texture, but rather keeps
a pointer to the one that you passed to this function.
If the source texture is destroyed and the shape tries to
use it, the behavior is undefined.
*texture* can be NULL to disable texturing.
If *reset_rect* is true, the TextureRect property of
the shape is automatically adjusted to the size of the new
texture. If it is false, the texture rect is left unchanged.

* *texture* - New texture
* *reset_rect* - Should the texture rect be reset to the size of the new texture?

*See also:* `texture`, `texture_rect=`

## SF::Shape#texture()

Get the source texture of the shape

If the shape has no source texture, a NULL pointer is returned.
The returned pointer is const, which means that you can't
modify the texture when you retrieve it with this function.

*Returns:* Pointer to the shape's texture

*See also:* `texture=`

## SF::Shape#texture()

:nodoc:

## SF::Shape#texture_rect()

Get the sub-rectangle of the texture displayed by the shape

*Returns:* Texture rectangle of the shape

*See also:* `texture_rect=`

## SF::Shape#texture_rect=(rect)

Set the sub-rectangle of the texture that the shape will display

The texture rect is useful when you don't want to display
the whole texture, but rather a part of it.
By default, the texture rect covers the entire texture.

* *rect* - Rectangle defining the region of the texture to display

*See also:* `texture_rect`, `texture=`

## SF::Shape#transform()

:nodoc:

## SF::Shape#update()

Recompute the internal geometry of the shape

This function must be called by the derived class everytime
the shape's points change (i.e. the result of either
`point_count` or `get_point` is different).

# SF::Sprite

Drawable representation of a texture, with its
own transformations, color, etc.

`SF::Sprite` is a drawable class that allows to easily display
a texture (or a part of it) on a render target.

It inherits all the functions from `SF::Transformable`:
position, rotation, scale, origin. It also adds sprite-specific
properties such as the texture to use, the part of it to display,
and some convenience functions to change the overall color of the
sprite, or to get its bounding rectangle.

`SF::Sprite` works in combination with the `SF::Texture` class, which
loads and provides the pixel data of a given texture.

The separation of `SF::Sprite` and `SF::Texture` allows more flexibility
and better performances: indeed a `SF::Texture` is a heavy resource,
and any operation on it is slow (often too slow for real-time
applications). On the other side, a `SF::Sprite` is a lightweight
object which can use the pixel data of a `SF::Texture` and draw
it with its own transformation/color/blending attributes.

It is important to note that the `SF::Sprite` instance doesn't
copy the texture that it uses, it only keeps a reference to it.
Thus, a `SF::Texture` must not be destroyed while it is
used by a `SF::Sprite` (i.e. never write a function that
uses a local `SF::Texture` instance for creating a sprite).

See also the note on coordinates and undistorted rendering in `SF::Transformable`.

Usage example:
```crystal
# Declare and load a texture
texture = SF::Texture.from_file("texture.png")

# Create a sprite
sprite = SF::Sprite.new
sprite.texture = texture
sprite.texture_rect = SF.int_rect(10, 10, 50, 30)
sprite.color = SF.color(255, 255, 255, 200)
sprite.position = {100, 25}

# Draw it
window.draw sprite
```

Change the source texture of the sprite

The *texture* argument refers to a texture that must
exist as long as the sprite uses it. Indeed, the sprite
doesn't store its own copy of the texture, but rather keeps
a pointer to the one that you passed to this function.
If the source texture is destroyed and the sprite tries to
use it, the behavior is undefined.
If *reset_rect* is true, the TextureRect property of
the sprite is automatically adjusted to the size of the new
texture. If it is false, the texture rect is left unchanged.

* *texture* - New texture
* *reset_rect* - Should the texture rect be reset to the size of the new texture?

*See also:* `texture`, `texture_rect=`

## SF::Sprite#texture()

Get the source texture of the sprite

If the sprite has no source texture, a NULL pointer is returned.
The returned pointer is const, which means that you can't
modify the texture when you retrieve it with this function.

*Returns:* Pointer to the sprite's texture

*See also:* `texture=`

## SF::Sprite#texture()

# SF::Text

Graphical text that can be drawn to a render target

`SF::Text` is a drawable class that allows to easily display
some text with custom style and color on a render target.

It inherits all the functions from `SF::Transformable`:
position, rotation, scale, origin. It also adds text-specific
properties such as the font to use, the character size,
the font style (bold, italic, underlined and strike through), the
text color, the outline thickness, the outline color, the character
spacing, the line spacing and the text to display of course.
It also provides convenience functions to calculate the
graphical size of the text, or to get the global position
of a given character.

`SF::Text` works in combination with the `SF::Font` class, which
loads and provides the glyphs (visual characters) of a given font.

The separation of `SF::Font` and `SF::Text` allows more flexibility
and better performances: indeed a `SF::Font` is a heavy resource,
and any operation on it is slow (often too slow for real-time
applications). On the other side, a `SF::Text` is a lightweight
object which can combine the glyphs data and metrics of a `SF::Font`
to display any text on a render target.

It is important to note that the `SF::Text` instance doesn't
copy the font that it uses, it only keeps a reference to it.
Thus, a `SF::Font` must not be destructed while it is
used by a `SF::Text` (i.e. never write a function that
uses a local `SF::Font` instance for creating a text).

See also the note on coordinates and undistorted rendering in `SF::Transformable`.

Usage example:
```crystal
# Declare and load a font
font = SF::Font.from_file("arial.ttf")

# Create a text
text = SF::Text.new("hello", font)
text.character_size = 30
text.style = SF::Text::Bold
text.color = SF::Color::Red

# Draw it

By default, the text's fill color is opaque white.
Setting the fill color to a transparent color with an outline
will cause the outline to be displayed in the fill area of the text.

* *color* - New fill color of the text

*See also:* `fill_color`

DEPRECATED: There is now fill and outline colors instead
of a single global color.

This function computes the visual position of a character
from its index in the string. The returned position is
in global coordinates (translation, rotation, scale and
origin are applied).
If *index* is out of range, the position of the end of
the string is returned.

* *index* - Index of the character

*Returns:* Position of the character

## SF::Text#font()

Get the text's font

If the text has no font attached, `nil` is returned.
The returned pointer is const, which means that you

*Returns:* Size of the letter spacing factor

*See also:* `letter_spacing=`

## SF::Text#letter_spacing=(spacing_factor)

Set the letter spacing factor

The default spacing between letters is defined by the font.
This factor doesn't directly apply to the existing
spacing between each character, it rather adds a fixed
space between them which is calculated from the font
metrics and the character size.
Note that factors below 1 (including negative numbers) bring
characters closer to each other.
By default the letter spacing factor is 1.

# SF::Texture

Image living on the graphics card that can be used for drawing

`SF::Texture` stores pixels that can be drawn, with a sprite
for example. A texture lives in the graphics card memory,
therefore it is very fast to draw a texture to a render target,
or copy a render target to a texture (the graphics card can
access both directly).

Being stored in the graphics card memory has some drawbacks.
A texture cannot be manipulated as freely as a `SF::Image`,
you need to prepare the pixels first and then upload them
to the texture in a single operation (see Texture.update).

`SF::Texture` makes it easy to convert from/to `SF::Image`, but
keep in mind that these calls require transfers between
the graphics card and the central memory, therefore they are
slow operations.

A texture can be loaded from an image, but also directly
from a file/memory/stream. The necessary shortcuts are defined
so that you don't need an image first for the most common cases.
However, if you want to perform some modifications on the pixels
before creating the final texture, you can load your file to a
`SF::Image`, do whatever you need with the pixels, and then call
`Texture.load_from_image`.

Since they live in the graphics card memory, the pixels of a texture
cannot be accessed without a slow copy first. And they cannot be
accessed individually. Therefore, if you need to read the texture's
pixels (like for pixel-perfect collisions), it is recommended to
store the collision information separately, for example in an array
of booleans.

Like `SF::Image`, `SF::Texture` can handle a unique internal
representation of pixels, which is RGBA 32 bits. This means
that a pixel must be composed of 8 bits red, green, blue and
alpha channels -- just like a `SF::Color`.

Usage example:
```crystal
# This example shows the most common use of SF::Texture:
# drawing a sprite

# Load a texture from a file
texture = SF::Texture.from_file("texture.png")

# Assign it to a sprite
sprite = SF::Sprite.new(texture)

# Draw the textured sprite
window.draw sprite
```

```crystal
# This example shows another common use of SF::Texture:
# streaming real-time data, like video frames

# Create an empty texture
texture = SF::Texture.new(640, 480)

# Create a sprite that will display the texture
sprite = SF::Sprite.new(texture)

# The main loop
loop do
  # [...]

  # update the texture
  pixels = (...).to_unsafe # get a fresh chunk of pixels (the next frame of a movie, for example)
  texture.update(pixels)

  # draw it
  window.draw sprite

  # [...]
end
```

Like `SF::Shader` that can be used as a raw OpenGL shader,
`SF::Texture` can also be used directly as a raw texture for
custom OpenGL geometry.
```crystal
SF::Texture.bind(texture)
# [... render OpenGL geometry ...]
SF::Texture.bind(nil)
```

*See also:* `SF::Sprite`, `SF::Image`, `SF::RenderTexture`

## SF::Texture::CoordinateType

Types of texture coordinates that can be used for rendering

### SF::Texture::CoordinateType::Normalized

Texture coordinates in range `0.0 .. 1.0`

### SF::Texture::CoordinateType::Pixels

Texture coordinates in range `0.0 .. size`

## SF::Texture.bind(texture,coordinate_type)

Bind a texture for rendering

This function is not part of the graphics API, it mustn't be
used when drawing SFML entities. It must be used only if you
mix `SF::Texture` with OpenGL code.

```crystal
t1 = SF::Texture.new
t2 = SF::Texture.new
# [...]
SF::Texture.bind t1
# draw OpenGL stuff that use t1...
SF::Texture.bind t2
# draw OpenGL stuff that use t2...
SF::Texture.bind nil
# draw OpenGL stuff that use no texture...
```

The *coordinate_type* argument controls how texture
coordinates will be interpreted. If Normalized (the default), they
must be in range `0.0 .. 1.0`, which is the default way of handling
texture coordinates with OpenGL. If Pixels, they must be given
in pixels (range `0.0 .. size`). This mode is used internally by
the graphics classes of SFML, it makes the definition of texture
coordinates more intuitive for the high-level API, users don't need
to compute normalized values.

* *texture* - Pointer to the texture to bind, can be null to use no texture
* *coordinate_type* - Type of texture coordinates to use

## SF::Texture#copy_to_image()

Copy the texture pixels to an image

This function performs a slow operation that downloads
the texture's pixels from the graphics card and copies
them to a new image, potentially applying transformations
to pixels if necessary (texture may be padded or flipped).

*Returns:* Image containing the texture's pixels

*See also:* `load_from_image`

## SF::Texture#create(width,height)

Create the texture

If this function fails, the texture is left unchanged.

* *width* - Width of the texture
* *height* - Height of the texture

*Returns:* True if creation was successful

## SF::Texture#finalize()

Destructor

## SF::Texture#generate_mipmap()

Generate a mipmap using the current texture data

Mipmaps are pre-computed chains of optimized textures. Each
level of texture in a mipmap is generated by halving each of
the previous level's dimensions. This is done until the final
level has the size of 1x1. The textures generated in this process may
make use of more advanced filters which might improve the visual quality
of textures when they are applied to objects much smaller than they are.
This is known as minification. Because fewer texels (texture elements)
have to be sampled from when heavily minified, usage of mipmaps
can also improve rendering performance in certain scenarios.

Mipmap generation relies on the necessary OpenGL extension being
available. If it is unavailable or generation fails due to another
reason, this function will return false. Mipmap data is only valid from
the time it is generated until the next time the base level image is
modified, at which point this function will have to be called again to
regenerate it.

*Returns:* True if mipmap generation was successful, false if unsuccessful

## SF::Texture#initialize()

Default constructor

Creates an empty texture.

## SF::Texture#initialize(copy)

:nodoc:

## SF::Texture#load_from_file(filename,area)

Load the texture from a file on disk

This function is a shortcut for the following code:
```crystal
image = SF::Image.new
image.load_from_file(filename)
texture.load_from_image(image, area)
```

The *area* argument can be used to load only a sub-rectangle
of the whole image. If you want the entire image then leave
the default value (which is an empty `IntRect`).
If the *area* rectangle crosses the bounds of the image, it
is adjusted to fit the image size.

The maximum size for a texture depends on the graphics
driver and can be retrieved with the maximum_size function.

If this function fails, the texture is left unchanged.

* *filename* - Path of the image file to load
* *area* - Area of the image to load

*Returns:* True if loading was successful

*See also:* `load_from_memory`, `load_from_stream`, `load_from_image`

## SF::Texture#load_from_image(image,area)

Load the texture from an image

The *area* argument can be used to load only a sub-rectangle
of the whole image. If you want the entire image then leave
the default value (which is an empty IntRect).
If the *area* rectangle crosses the bounds of the image, it
is adjusted to fit the image size.

The maximum size for a texture depends on the graphics
driver and can be retrieved with the maximum_size function.

If this function fails, the texture is left unchanged.

* *image* - Image to load into the texture
* *area* - Area of the image to load

*Returns:* True if loading was successful

*See also:* `load_from_file`, `load_from_memory`

## SF::Texture#load_from_memory(data,area)

Load the texture from a file in memory

This function is a shortcut for the following code:
```crystal
image = SF::Image.new
image.load_from_memory(data, size)
texture.load_from_image(image, area)
```

The *area* argument can be used to load only a sub-rectangle
of the whole image. If you want the entire image then leave
the default value (which is an empty `IntRect`).
If the *area* rectangle crosses the bounds of the image, it
is adjusted to fit the image size.

The maximum size for a texture depends on the graphics
driver and can be retrieved with the maximum_size function.

If this function fails, the texture is left unchanged.

* *data* - Slice containing the file data in memory
* *area* - Area of the image to load

*Returns:* True if loading was successful

*See also:* `load_from_file`, `load_from_stream`, `load_from_image`

## SF::Texture#load_from_stream(stream,area)

Load the texture from a custom stream

This function is a shortcut for the following code:
```crystal
image = SF::Image.new
image.load_from_stream(stream)
texture.load_from_image(image, area)
```

The *area* argument can be used to load only a sub-rectangle
of the whole image. If you want the entire image then leave
the default value (which is an empty IntRect).
If the *area* rectangle crosses the bounds of the image, it
is adjusted to fit the image size.

The maximum size for a texture depends on the graphics
driver and can be retrieved with the maximum_size function.

If this function fails, the texture is left unchanged.

* *stream* - Source stream to read from
* *area* - Area of the image to load

*Returns:* True if loading was successful

*See also:* `load_from_file`, `load_from_memory`, `load_from_image`

## SF::Texture.maximum_size()

Get the maximum texture size allowed

This maximum size is defined by the graphics driver.
You can expect a value of 512 pixels for low-end graphics
card, and up to 8192 pixels or more for newer hardware.

*Returns:* Maximum size allowed for textures, in pixels

## SF::Texture#native_handle()

Get the underlying OpenGL handle of the texture.

You shouldn't need to use this function, unless you have
very specific stuff to implement that SFML doesn't support,
or implement a temporary workaround until a bug is fixed.

*Returns:* OpenGL handle of the texture or 0 if not yet created

## SF::Texture#repeated?()

Tell whether the texture is repeated or not

*Returns:* True if repeat mode is enabled, false if it is disabled

*See also:* `repeated=`

## SF::Texture#repeated=(repeated)

Enable or disable repeating

Repeating is involved when using texture coordinates
outside the texture rectangle [0, 0, width, height].
In this case, if repeat mode is enabled, the whole texture
will be repeated as many times as needed to reach the
coordinate (for example, if the X texture coordinate is
3 * width, the texture will be repeated 3 times).
If repeat mode is disabled, the "extra space" will instead
be filled with border pixels.

WARNING: On very old graphics cards, white pixels may appear
when the texture is repeated. With such cards, repeat mode
can be used reliably only if the texture has power-of-two
dimensions (such as 256x128).
Repeating is disabled by default.

* *repeated* - True to repeat the texture, false to disable repeating

*See also:* `repeated?`

## SF::Texture#size()

Return the size of the texture

*Returns:* Size in pixels

## SF::Texture#smooth?()

Tell whether the smooth filter is enabled or not

*Returns:* True if smoothing is enabled, false if it is disabled

*See also:* `smooth=`

## SF::Texture#smooth=(smooth)

Enable or disable the smooth filter

When the filter is activated, the texture appears smoother
so that pixels are less noticeable. However if you want
the texture to look exactly the same as its source file,
you should leave it disabled.
The smooth filter is disabled by default.

* *smooth* - True to enable smoothing, false to disable it

*See also:* `smooth?`

## SF::Texture#srgb?()

Tell whether the texture source is converted from sRGB or not

*Returns:* True if the texture source is converted from sRGB, false if not

*See also:* `srgb=`

## SF::Texture#srgb=(s_rgb)

Enable or disable conversion from sRGB

When providing texture data from an image file or memory, it can
either be stored in a linear color space or an sRGB color space.
Most digital images account for gamma correction already, so they
would need to be "uncorrected" back to linear color space before
being processed by the hardware. The hardware can automatically
convert it from the sRGB color space to a linear color space when
it gets sampled. When the rendered image gets output to the final
framebuffer, it gets converted back to sRGB.

After enabling or disabling sRGB conversion, make sure to reload
the texture data in order for the setting to take effect.

This option is only useful in conjunction with an sRGB capable
framebuffer. This can be requested during window creation.

* *s_rgb* - True to enable sRGB conversion, false to disable it

*See also:* `srgb?`

## SF::Texture#swap(right)

Swap the contents of this texture with those of another

* *right* - Instance to swap with

## SF::Texture#update(image)

Update the texture from an image

Although the source image can be smaller than the texture,
this function is usually used for updating the whole texture.
The other overload, which has (x, y) additional arguments,
is more convenient for updating a sub-area of the texture.

No additional check is performed on the size of the image,
passing an image bigger than the texture will lead to an
undefined behavior.

# SF::Transform

Define a 3x3 transform matrix

A `SF::Transform` specifies how to translate, rotate, scale,
shear, project, whatever things. In mathematical terms, it defines
how to transform a coordinate system into another.

For example, if you apply a rotation transform to a sprite, the
result will be a rotated sprite. And anything that is transformed
by this rotation transform will be rotated the same way, according
to its initial position.

Transforms are typically used for drawing. But they can also be
used for any computation that requires to transform points between
the local and global coordinate systems of an entity (like collision
detection).

Example:
```crystal
# define a translation transform
translation = SF::Transform.new
translation.translate(20, 50)

# define a rotation transform
rotation = SF::Transform.new
rotation.rotate(45)

# combine them
transform = translation * rotation

# use the result to transform stuff...
point = transform.transform_point(10, 20)
rect = transform.transform_rect(SF.float_rect(0, 0, 10, 100))

# SF::Transformable

Decomposed transform defined by a position, a rotation and a scale

This class is provided for convenience, on top of `SF::Transform`.

`SF::Transform`, as a low-level class, offers a great level of
flexibility but it is not always convenient to manage. Indeed,
one can easily combine any kind of operation, such as a translation
followed by a rotation followed by a scaling, but once the result
transform is built, there's no way to go backward and, let's say,
change only the rotation without modifying the translation and scaling.
The entire transform must be recomputed, which means that you
need to retrieve the initial translation and scale factors as
well, and combine them the same way you did before updating the
rotation. This is a tedious operation, and it requires to store
all the individual components of the final transform.

That's exactly what `SF::Transformable` was written for: it hides
these variables and the composed transform behind an easy to use
interface. You can set or get any of the individual components
without worrying about the others. It also provides the composed
transform (as a `SF::Transform`), and keeps it up-to-date.

In addition to the position, rotation and scale, `SF::Transformable`
provides an "origin" component, which represents the local origin
of the three other components. Let's take an example with a 10x10
pixels sprite. By default, the sprite is positioned/rotated/scaled
relatively to its top-left corner, because it is the local point
(0, 0). But if we change the origin to be (5, 5), the sprite will
be positioned/rotated/scaled around its center instead. And if
we set the origin to (10, 10), it will be transformed around its
bottom-right corner.

To keep the `SF::Transformable` class simple, there's only one
origin for all the components. You cannot position the sprite
relatively to its top-left corner while rotating it around its
center, for example. To do such things, use `SF::Transform` directly.

`SF::Transformable` can be used as a base class. It is often
combined with `SF::Drawable` -- that's what SFML's sprites,
texts and shapes do.
```crystal
class MyEntity < SF::Transformable
  include SF::Drawable

  def draw(target, states)
    states.transform *= self.transform
    target.draw(..., states)
  end
end

entity = MyEntity.new
entity.position = {10, 20}
entity.rotation = 45
window.draw entity
```

It can also be used as a member, if you don't want to use
its API directly (because you don't need all its functions,
or you have different naming conventions for example).
```crystal
class MyEntity
  @transform : SF::Transformable
  forward_missing_to @transform
end
```

A note on coordinates and undistorted rendering:
By default, SFML (or more exactly, OpenGL) may interpolate drawable objects
such as sprites or texts when rendering. While this allows transitions
like slow movements or rotations to appear smoothly, it can lead to
unwanted results in some cases, for example blurred or distorted objects.
In order to render a `SF::Drawable` object pixel-perfectly, make sure
the involved coordinates allow a 1:1 mapping of pixels in the window
to texels (pixels in the texture). More specifically, this means:

* The object's position, origin and scale have no fractional part
* The object's and the view's rotation are a multiple of 90 degrees
* The view's center and size have no fractional part

*See also:* `SF::Transform`

# SF::Vertex

Define a point with color and texture coordinates

A vertex is an improved point. It has a position and other
extra attributes that will be used for drawing: in SFML,
vertices also have a color and a pair of texture coordinates.

The vertex is the building block of drawing. Everything which
is visible on screen is made of vertices. They are grouped
as 2D primitives (triangles, quads, ...), and these primitives
are grouped to create even more complex 2D entities such as
sprites, texts, etc.

If you use the graphical entities of SFML (sprite, text, shape)
you won't have to deal with vertices directly. But if you want
to define your own 2D entities, such as tiled maps or particle
systems, using vertices will allow you to get maximum performances.

Example:
```crystal
# define a 100x100 square, red, with a 10x10 texture mapped on it
vertices = [
  SF::Vertex.new(SF.vector2f(0, 0), SF::Color::Red, SF.vector2f(0, 0)),
  SF::Vertex.new(SF.vector2f(0, 100), SF::Color::Red, SF.vector2f(0, 10)),
  SF::Vertex.new(SF.vector2f(100, 100), SF::Color::Red, SF.vector2f(10, 10)),
  SF::Vertex.new(SF.vector2f(100, 0), SF::Color::Red, SF.vector2f(10, 0)),
]

# draw it
window.draw(vertices, SF::Quads)
```

Note: although texture coordinates are supposed to be an integer
amount of pixels, their type is float because of some buggy graphics
drivers that are not able to process integer coordinates correctly.

```crystal
lines = SF::VertexArray.new(SF::LineStrip, 4)

# SF::VertexBuffer

Vertex buffer storage for one or more 2D primitives

`SF::VertexBuffer` is a simple wrapper around a dynamic
buffer of vertices and a primitives type.

Unlike `SF::VertexArray`, the vertex data is stored in
graphics memory.

In situations where a large amount of vertex data would
have to be transferred from system memory to graphics memory
every frame, using `SF::VertexBuffer` can help. By using a
`SF::VertexBuffer`, data that has not been changed between frames
does not have to be re-transferred from system to graphics
memory as would be the case with `SF::VertexArray`. If data transfer
is a bottleneck, this can lead to performance gains.

Using `SF::VertexBuffer`, the user also has the ability to only modify
a portion of the buffer in graphics memory. This way, a large buffer
can be allocated at the start of the application and only the
applicable portions of it need to be updated during the course of
the application. This allows the user to take full control of data
transfers between system and graphics memory if they need to.

In special cases, the user can make use of multiple threads to update
vertex data in multiple distinct regions of the buffer simultaneously.
This might make sense when e.g. the position of multiple objects has to
be recalculated very frequently. The computation load can be spread
across multiple threads as long as there are no other data dependencies.

Simultaneous updates to the vertex buffer are not guaranteed to be
carried out by the driver in any specific order. Updating the same
region of the buffer from multiple threads will not cause undefined
behaviour, however the final state of the buffer will be unpredictable.

Simultaneous updates of distinct non-overlapping regions of the buffer
are also not guaranteed to complete in a specific order. However, in
this case the user can make sure to synchronize the writer threads at
well-defined points in their code. The driver will make sure that all
pending data transfers complete before the vertex buffer is sourced
by the rendering pipeline.

It inherits `SF::Drawable`, but unlike other drawables it
is not transformable.

Example:
```c++
sf::Vertex vertices[15];
// [...]
sf::VertexBuffer triangles(sf::Triangles);
triangles.create(15);
triangles.update(vertices);
// [...]
window.draw(triangles);
```

## SF::VertexBuffer::Usage

Usage specifiers

If data is going to be updated once or more every frame,
set the usage to `Stream`. If data is going to be set once
and used for a long time without being modified, set the
usage to `Static`. For everything else `Dynamic` should be a
good compromise.

### SF::VertexBuffer::Usage::Dynamic

Occasionally changing data

### SF::VertexBuffer::Usage::Static

Rarely changing data

### SF::VertexBuffer::Usage::Stream

Constantly changing data

## SF::VertexBuffer.available?()

Tell whether or not the system supports vertex buffers

This function should always be called before using
the vertex buffer features. If it returns false, then
any attempt to use `SF::VertexBuffer` will fail.

*Returns:* True if vertex buffers are supported, false otherwise

## SF::VertexBuffer.bind(vertex_buffer)

Bind a vertex buffer for rendering

This function is not part of the graphics API, it mustn't be
used when drawing SFML entities. It must be used only if you
mix `SF::VertexBuffer` with OpenGL code.

```c++
sf::VertexBuffer vb1, vb2;
...
sf::VertexBuffer::bind(&vb1);
// draw OpenGL stuff that use vb1...
sf::VertexBuffer::bind(&vb2);
// draw OpenGL stuff that use vb2...
sf::VertexBuffer::bind(NULL);
// draw OpenGL stuff that use no vertex buffer...
```

* *vertex_buffer* - Pointer to the vertex buffer to bind, can be null to use no vertex buffer

## SF::VertexBuffer#create(vertex_count)

Create the vertex buffer

Creates the vertex buffer and allocates enough graphics
memory to hold *vertex_count* vertices. Any previously
allocated memory is freed in the process.

In order to deallocate previously allocated memory pass 0
as *vertex_count*. Don't forget to recreate with a non-zero
value when graphics memory should be allocated again.

* *vertex_count* - Number of vertices worth of memory to allocate

*Returns:* True if creation was successful

very specific stuff to implement that SFML doesn't support,
or implement a temporary workaround until a bug is fixed.

*Returns:* OpenGL handle of the vertex buffer or 0 if not yet created

## SF::VertexBuffer#primitive_type()

Get the type of primitives drawn by the vertex buffer

*Returns:* Primitive type

## SF::VertexBuffer#primitive_type=(type)

Swap the contents of this vertex buffer with those of another

* *right* - Instance to swap with

## SF::VertexBuffer#update(vertex_buffer)

Copy the contents of another buffer into this buffer

* *vertex_buffer* - Vertex buffer whose contents to copy into this vertex buffer

*Returns:* True if the copy was successful

## SF::VertexBuffer#update(vertices)

Update the whole buffer from an array of vertices

The *vertex* array is assumed to have the same size as
the *created* buffer.

No additional check is performed on the size of the vertex
array, passing invalid arguments will lead to undefined
behavior.

This function does nothing if *vertices* is null or if the
buffer was not previously created.

* *vertices* - Array of vertices to copy to the buffer

*Returns:* True if the update was successful

## SF::VertexBuffer#update(vertices,offset)

Update a part of the buffer from an array of vertices

*offset* is specified as the number of vertices to skip
from the beginning of the buffer.

If *offset* is 0 and *vertex_count* is equal to the size of
the currently created buffer, its whole contents are replaced.

If *offset* is 0 and *vertex_count* is greater than the
size of the currently created buffer, a new buffer is created
containing the vertex data.

If *offset* is 0 and *vertex_count* is less than the size of
the currently created buffer, only the corresponding region
is updated.

If *offset* is not 0 and *offset* + *vertex_count* is greater
than the size of the currently created buffer, the update fails.

No additional check is performed on the size of the vertex
array, passing invalid arguments will lead to undefined
behavior.

* *vertices* - Array of vertices to copy to the buffer
* *vertex_count* - Number of vertices to copy
* *offset* - Offset in the buffer to copy to

*Returns:* True if the update was successful

## SF::VertexBuffer#usage()

This function provides a hint about how this vertex buffer is
going to be used in terms of data update frequency.

After changing the usage specifier, the vertex buffer has
to be updated with new data for the usage specifier to
take effect.

The default primitive type is `SF::VertexBuffer::Stream`.

* *usage* - Usage specifier

## SF::VertexBuffer#vertex_count()

Return the vertex count

*Returns:* Number of vertices in the vertex buffer

# SF::View

2D camera that defines what region is shown on screen

`SF::View` defines a camera in the 2D scene. This is a
very powerful concept: you can scroll, rotate or zoom
the entire scene without altering the way that your
drawable objects are drawn.

A view is composed of a source rectangle, which defines
what part of the 2D scene is shown, and a target viewport,
which defines where the contents of the source rectangle
will be displayed on the render target (window or texture).

The viewport allows to map the scene to a custom part
of the render target, and can be used for split-screen
or for displaying a minimap, for example. If the source
rectangle doesn't have the same size as the viewport, its
contents will be stretched to fit in.

To apply a view, you have to assign it to the render target.
Then, objects drawn in this render target will be
affected by the view until you use another view.

Usage example:
```crystal
window = SF::RenderWindow.new
view = SF::View.new

# Initialize the view to a rectangle located at (100, 100) and with a size of 400x200
view.reset(SF.float_rect(100, 100, 400, 200))

# Rotate it by 45 degrees
view.rotate(45)

# Set its target viewport to be half of the window
view.viewport = SF.float_rect(0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0)

# Apply it
window.view = view

# Render stuff
window.draw some_sprite

# Set the default view back
window.view = window.default_view

# Render stuff not affected by the view
window.draw some_text
```
