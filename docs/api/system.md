# SF::Clock

Utility class that measures the elapsed time

`SF::Clock` is a lightweight class for measuring time.

Its provides the most precise time that the underlying
OS can achieve (generally microseconds or nanoseconds).
It also ensures monotonicity, which means that the returned
time can never go backward, even if the system time is
changed.

Usage example:
```crystal
clock = SF::Clock.new
# [...]
time1 = clock.elapsed_time
# [...]
time2 = clock.restart()
```

The `SF::Time` value returned by the clock can then be
converted to a number of seconds, milliseconds or even
microseconds.

*See also:* `SF::Time`

## SF::Clock#elapsed_time()

Get the elapsed time

This function returns the time elapsed since the last call
to `restart()` (or the construction of the instance if `restart()`
has not been called).

*Returns:* Time elapsed

## SF::Clock#initialize()

Default constructor

The clock starts automatically after being constructed.

## SF::Clock#initialize(copy)

:nodoc:

## SF::Clock#restart()

Restart the clock

This function puts the time counter back to zero.
It also returns the time elapsed since the clock was started.

*Returns:* Time elapsed

# SF::FileInputStream

Implementation of input stream based on a file

This class is a specialization of `InputStream` that
reads from a file on disk.

It wraps a file in the common `InputStream` interface
and therefore allows to use generic classes or functions
that accept such a stream, with a file on disk as the data
source.

In addition to the virtual functions inherited from
`InputStream`, `FileInputStream` adds a function to
specify the file to open.

SFML resource classes can usually be loaded directly from
a filename, so this class shouldn't be useful to you unless
you create your own algorithms that operate on an `InputStream`

Usage example:
```crystal
def process(stream : InputStream)
end

stream = SF::FileInputStream.open("some_file.dat")
process(stream)
```

See also: `InputStream`, `MemoryInputStream`

## SF::FileInputStream#finalize()

Default destructor

## SF::FileInputStream#initialize()

Default constructor

## SF::FileInputStream#open(filename)

Open the stream from a file path

* *filename* - Name of the file to open

*Returns:* True on success, false on error

## SF::FileInputStream#read(data)

Read data from the stream

After reading, the stream's reading position must be
advanced by the amount of bytes read.

* *data* - Buffer where to copy the read data

*Returns:* The number of bytes actually read, or -1 on error

## SF::FileInputStream#seek(position)

Change the current reading position

* *position* - The position to seek to, from the beginning

*Returns:* The position actually sought to, or -1 on error

## SF::FileInputStream#size()

Return the size of the stream

*Returns:* The total number of bytes available in the stream, or -1 on error

## SF::FileInputStream#tell()

Get the current reading position in the stream

*Returns:* The current position, or -1 on error.

# SF::InputStream

Abstract class for custom file input streams

This class allows users to define their own file input sources
from which SFML can load resources.

SFML resource classes like `SF::Texture` and
`SF::SoundBuffer` provide load_from_file and load_from_memory functions,
which read data from conventional sources. However, if you
have data coming from a different source (over a network,
embedded, encrypted, compressed, etc) you can derive your
own class from `SF::InputStream` and load SFML resources with
their load_from_stream function.

Usage example:
```crystal
# custom stream class that reads from inside a zip file
class ZipStream < SF::InputStream
    def initialize(archive : String)

    def open(filename : String)

    def read(data : Slice) : Int64

    def seek(position : Int) : Int64

    def tell : Int64

    def size : Int64

    # [...]
end

# now you can load textures...
stream = ZipStream.new("resources.zip")
stream.open("images/img.png")
texture = SF::Texture.from_stream(stream)

# musics...
stream = ZipStream.new("resources.zip")
stream.open("musics/msc.ogg")
music = SF::Music.from_stream(stream)

# etc.
```

## SF::InputStream#read(data)

Read data from the stream

After reading, the stream's reading position must be
advanced by the amount of bytes read.

* *data* - Buffer where to copy the read data

*Returns:* The number of bytes actually read, or -1 on error

## SF::InputStream#seek(position)

Change the current reading position

* *position* - The position to seek to, from the beginning

*Returns:* The position actually sought to, or -1 on error

## SF::InputStream#size()

Return the size of the stream

*Returns:* The total number of bytes available in the stream, or -1 on error

## SF::InputStream#tell()

Get the current reading position in the stream

*Returns:* The current position, or -1 on error.

# SF::MemoryInputStream

Implementation of input stream based on a memory chunk

This class is a specialization of `InputStream` that
reads from data in memory.

It wraps a memory chunk in the common `InputStream` interface
and therefore allows to use generic classes or functions
that accept such a stream, with content already loaded in memory.

In addition to the virtual functions inherited from
`InputStream`, `MemoryInputStream` adds a function to
specify the pointer and size of the data in memory.

SFML resource classes can usually be loaded directly from
memory, so this class shouldn't be useful to you unless
you create your own algorithms that operate on an InputStream.

Usage example:
```crystal
def process(stream : InputStream)
end

stream = SF::MemoryInputStream.open(slice)
process(stream)
```

See also: `InputStream`, `FileInputStream`

## SF::MemoryInputStream#initialize()

Default constructor

## SF::MemoryInputStream#initialize(copy)

:nodoc:

## SF::MemoryInputStream#open(data)

* *data* - Pointer to the data in memory

## SF::MemoryInputStream#read(data)

Read data from the stream

After reading, the stream's reading position must be
advanced by the amount of bytes read.

* *data* - Buffer where to copy the read data

*Returns:* The number of bytes actually read, or -1 on error

## SF::MemoryInputStream#seek(position)

Change the current reading position

* *position* - The position to seek to, from the beginning

*Returns:* The position actually sought to, or -1 on error

## SF::MemoryInputStream#size()

Return the size of the stream

*Returns:* The total number of bytes available in the stream, or -1 on error

## SF::MemoryInputStream#tell()

Get the current reading position in the stream

*Returns:* The current position, or -1 on error.

# SF::Mutex

Blocks concurrent access to shared resources
from multiple threads

Mutex stands for "MUTual EXclusion". A mutex is a
synchronization object, used when multiple threads are involved.

When you want to protect a part of the code from being accessed
simultaneously by multiple threads, you typically use a
mutex. When a thread is locked by a mutex, any other thread
trying to lock it will be blocked until the mutex is released
by the thread that locked it. This way, you can allow only
one thread at a time to access a critical region of your code.

Usage example:
```crystal
@database = Database.new # this is a critical resource that needs some protection
@mutex = SF::Mutex.new

def thread1()
  @mutex.lock() # this call will block the thread if the mutex is already locked by thread2
  @database.write(...)
  @mutex.unlock() # if thread2 was waiting, it will now be unblocked
end

def thread2()
  @mutex.lock() # this call will block the thread if the mutex is already locked by thread1
  @database.write(...)
  @mutex.unlock() # if thread1 was waiting, it will now be unblocked
end
```

Be very careful with mutexes. A bad usage can lead to bad problems,
like deadlocks (two threads are waiting for each other and the
application is globally stuck).

To make the usage of mutexes more robust, particularly in
environments where exceptions can be thrown, you should
use the helper method `synchronize` to lock/unlock mutexes.

SFML mutexes are recursive, which means that you can lock
a mutex multiple times in the same thread without creating
a deadlock. In this case, the first call to `lock()` behaves
as usual, and the following ones have no effect.
However, you must call `unlock()` exactly as many times as you
called `lock()`. If you don't, the mutex won't be released.
However, you must call unlock() exactly as many times as you
called lock(). If you don't, the mutex won't be released.

*See also:* `SF::Lock`

## SF::Mutex#finalize()

Destructor

## SF::Mutex#initialize()

Default constructor

## SF::Mutex#lock()

Lock the mutex

If the mutex is already locked in another thread,
this call will block the execution until the mutex
is released.

*See also:* `unlock`

## SF::Mutex#unlock()

Unlock the mutex

*See also:* `lock`

# SF::NonCopyable

Empty module that indicates the objects of the class can't be copied

# SF::Thread

Utility class to manipulate threads

Threads provide a way to run multiple parts of the code
in parallel. When you launch a new thread, the execution
is split and both the new thread and the caller run
in parallel.

To use a `SF::Thread`, you construct it directly with the
function to execute as the entry point of the thread.
`SF::Thread` has multiple template constructors, which means
that you can use several types of entry points:

* non-member functions with no argument
* non-member functions with one argument of any type
* functors with no argument (this one is particularly useful for compatibility with boost/std::%bind)
* functors with one argument of any type
* member functions from any class with no argument

The function argument, if any, is copied in the `SF::Thread`
instance, as well as the functor (if the corresponding
constructor is used). Class instances, however, are passed
by pointer so you must make sure that the object won't be
destroyed while the thread is still using it.

The thread ends when its function is terminated. If the
owner `SF::Thread` instance is destroyed before the
thread is finished, the destructor will wait (see `wait()`)

Usage examples:
```c++
# example 1: non member function with one argument

void threadFunc(int argument)
    // [...]
end

thread = SF::Thread.new(&threadFunc, 5)
thread.launch() # start the thread (internally calls threadFunc(5))
```

```c++
# example 2: member function

class Task
public:
    void run()
        // [...]
    end
end

Task task
thread = SF::Thread.new(&Task.run, &task)
thread.launch() # start the thread (internally calls task.run())
```

```c++
# example 3: functor

struct Task
    void operator()()
        // [...]
    end
end

thread = SF::Thread.new(Task())
thread.launch() # start the thread (internally calls operator() on the Task instance)
```

Creating parallel threads of execution can be dangerous:
all threads inside the same process share the same memory space,
which means that you may end up accessing the same variable
from multiple threads at the same time. To prevent this
kind of situations, you can use mutexes (see `SF::Mutex`).

*See also:* `SF::Mutex`

## SF::Thread#finalize()

Destructor

This destructor calls `wait()`, so that the internal thread
cannot survive after its `SF::Thread` instance is destroyed.

## SF::Thread#initialize(function)

Construct the thread from a functor with an argument

This constructor works for function objects, as well
as free functions.
It is a template, which means that the argument can
have any type (int, std::string, void*, Toto, ...).

Use this constructor for this kind of function:
```c++
void function(int arg)

# --- or ----

struct Functor
    void operator()(std::string arg)
end
```

Note: this does *not* run the thread, use `launch()`.

* *function* - Functor or free function to use as the entry point of the thread
* *argument* - argument to forward to the function

## SF::Thread#launch()

Run the thread

This function starts the entry point passed to the
thread's constructor, and returns immediately.
After this function returns, the thread's function is
running in parallel to the calling code.

## SF::Thread#terminate()

Terminate the thread

This function immediately stops the thread, without waiting
for its function to finish.
Terminating a thread with this function is not safe,
and can lead to local variables not being destroyed
on some operating systems. You should rather try to make
the thread function terminate by itself.

## SF::Thread#wait()

Wait until the thread finishes

This function will block the execution until the
thread's function ends.

WARNING: If the thread function never ends, the calling
thread will block forever.
If this function is called from its owner thread, it
returns without doing anything.

# SF::Time

Represents a time value

`SF::Time` encapsulates a time value in a flexible way.
It allows to define a time value either as a number of
seconds, milliseconds or microseconds. It also works the
other way round: you can read a time value as either
a number of seconds, milliseconds or microseconds.

By using such a flexible interface, the API doesn't
impose any fixed type or resolution for time values,
and let the user choose its own favorite representation.

Time values support the usual mathematical operations:
you can add or subtract two times, multiply or divide
a time by a number, compare two times, etc.

Since they represent a time span and not an absolute time
value, times can also be negative.

Usage example:
```crystal
t1 = SF.seconds(0.1)
milli = t1.as_milliseconds # 100

t2 = SF.milliseconds(30)
micro = t2.as_microseconds # 30000

t3 = SF.microseconds(-800000)
sec = t3.as_seconds # -0.8
```

```crystal
def update(elapsed : SF::Time)
  @position += @speed * elapsed.as_seconds
end

update(SF.milliseconds(100))
```
